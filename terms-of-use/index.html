                  If you believe your own copyrighted material has been removed
                  from the Site as a result of a mistake or misidentification,
                  you may submit a written counter notification to [us/our
                  Designated Copyright Agent] using the contact information
                  provided below (a “Counter Notification”). To be an effective
                  Counter Notification under the DMCA, your Counter Notification
                  must include substantially the following: (1) identification
                  of the material that has been removed or disabled and the
                  location at which the material appeared before it was removed
                  or disabled; (2) a statement that you consent to the
                  jurisdiction of the Federal District Court in which your

                  your name, address, and telephone number; (5) a statement
                  under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief
                  that the material in question was removed or disabled as a
                  result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be
                  removed or disabled; and (6) your physical or electronic
                  signature.

                  If you send us a valid, written Counter Notification meeting
                  the requirements described above, we will restore your removed
                  or disabled material, unless we first receive notice from the
                  party filing the Notification informing us that such party has
                  filed a court action to restrain you from engaging in
                  infringing activity related to the material in question.
                  Please note that if you materially misrepresent that the
                  disabled or removed content was removed by mistake or
                  misidentification, you may be liable for damages, including
                  costs and attorney’s fees. Filing a false Counter Notification
                  constitutes perjury.

                <h4>Informal Negotiations</h4>
                <p>
                  To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute,
                  controversy, or claim related to these Terms (each a “Dispute”
                  and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us
                  (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the
                  Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute
                  (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally
                  for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration.
                  Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from
                  one Party to the other Party.
                </p>
                <h4>Binding Arbitration</h4>
                <p>
                  If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through
                  informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes
                  expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively
                  resolved by binding arbitration.
                  <strong
                    >You understand that without this provision, you would have
                    the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.</strong
                  >
                  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the
                  Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
                  Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s
                  Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA
                  Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA
                  website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of
                  arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer
                  Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer
                  Rules. If such costs are determined to by the arbitrator to be
                  excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The
                  arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission
                  of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a
                  decision in
                  <span style="font-weight: 400">writing but</span> need not
                  provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either
                  Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any
                  award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
                  Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or
                  applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Kent
                  County, DE. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties
                  may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings
                  pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter
                  judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than
                  arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in
                  the state and federal courts located in Kent County, DE, and
                  the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack
                  of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with
                  respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal
                  courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on
                  Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform
                  Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from
                  these Terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related
                  in any way to the Site be commenced more than one (1) years
                  after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to
                  be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to
                  arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
                  provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such
                  Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction
                  within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the
                  Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that
                  court.
                </p>
                <h4>Restrictions</h4>
                <p>
                  The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the
                  Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent
                  permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any
                  other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any
                  Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize
                  class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or
                  authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
                  representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any
                  other persons.
                </p>
                <h4>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h4>
                <p>
                  The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject
                  to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and
                  binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or
                  protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the
                  intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute
                  related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy,
                  invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim
                  for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be

                  These Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law.
                  We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to

                  provision of these Terms is determined to be unlawful, void,
                  or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is

            We hope you've found what you need and can
            <strong>avoid the time, costs, and stress</strong> associated with
            dealing with a lawyer.
          </p>
          <p>
            A review would mean the world to us (it only takes about 15
