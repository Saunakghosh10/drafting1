										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An agent (or attorney-in-fact) under a <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/power-of-attorney/">power of attorney</a> is someone appointed and authorized by the principal to make decisions for them if and when they become incapacitated or are unavailable.</p>
<p>While agents must fulfill their legal responsibilities to the principal under the power of attorney, balancing that with their obligations to the principal&#8217;s family members is crucial. Their decisions can impact the principal&#8217;s family, especially if their views clash.</p>
<p>Learn more about an agent&#8217;s duties and their power of attorney obligations to family members, as well as tips for the principal in expressing their wishes and providing clear instructions.</p>

<h2>Agent&#8217;s Obligations</h2>
<p>When someone is appointed the agent under a power of attorney, they have certain legal obligations not only to the principal but also to the principal&#8217;s family members. These obligations vary depending on the type and scope of powers granted in the power of attorney.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-54724" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/power-of-attorney-agents-obligation-to-family-members.png" alt="power of attorney agent's obligation to family members" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/power-of-attorney-agents-obligation-to-family-members.png 1024w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/power-of-attorney-agents-obligation-to-family-members-300x225.png 300w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/power-of-attorney-agents-obligation-to-family-members-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3 id="“”this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”“">Clear Communication</h3>
<p>Unless the power of attorney document dictates otherwise, agents aren&#8217;t legally bound to disclose actions to the principal&#8217;s family. Nonetheless, clear communication promotes transparency and trust.</p>
<p>When a close family member or friend is the agent, engaging other family members in decisions becomes especially important so no one feels excluded or left out.</p>
<p>To maintain a positive rapport with the principal&#8217;s family, the agent should maintain transparency in situations like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Planning to sell a property owned by the principal where the principal&#8217;s family resides;</li>
<li>Considering to sell high-value assets or sentimental items;</li>
<li>Engaging third-party assistance, such as caregivers for the principal;</li>
<li>Contemplating legal actions to uphold the principal&#8217;s wishes;</li>
<li>Making critical medical choices, including consenting to particular procedures;</li>
<li>Enacting provisions from a <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/living-will/">living will</a>, such as preferences about resuscitation or intubation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Agents should maintain empathy for the principal&#8217;s family members dealing with the potential deterioration and loss of their loved one and try to disclose as much information as is legally appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="“”this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”“">Maintain Confidentiality</h3>
<p>While transparency can promote healthy, positive relationships with family members of the principal, the agent has a legal obligation to maintain confidentiality in some circumstances.</p>
<p>Some examples of what an agent should not disclose to anyone due to confidentiality include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal financial information that is not relevant to the family members&#8217; well-being or decision-making process;</li>
<li>Principal&#8217;s health and medical information that is protected by privacy rules (such as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HIPAA</a>);</li>
<li>Legal matters or disputes that are confidential in nature;</li>
<li>Any other sensitive information that could potentially harm the principal or their family members if disclosed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="“”this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”“">Fulfill Fiduciary Duties</h3>
<p>The agent has a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fiduciary_duty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fiduciary duty</a> towards the principal, and that duty can extend to the principal&#8217;s family members. This means the agent must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide care, support and ensure the well-being of the principal&#8217;s family members;</li>
<li>Act consistently in their best interests, being loyal, and making decisions with utmost competence;</li>
<li>Manage the principal&#8217;s affairs diligently and transparently;</li>
<li>Avoid conflicts of interest and always prioritize the principal&#8217;s welfare above all else.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, if the principal does not want to provide care or support to their family members, their agent should not either, acting in line with the principal&#8217;s wishes.</p>
 <aside class="tip style-tip size-small align-none"> <div> <header> <svg class="icon icon-lightbulb-on" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img"> <use xlink:href="#icon-lightbulb-on"></use> </svg> <h4>Can power of attorney keep family members away?</h4> </header> <p>An agent may have the right to keep the principal&#8217;s family members away if the principal specifically instructed the agent to do so in the power of attorney document. As with most aspects of a power of attorney, whether the agent has this power depends on the principal&#8217;s specified wishes.</p> </div> </aside> 
<h3 id="“”this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”“">Keep Records</h3>
<p>By keeping thorough and detailed records of financial affairs and health care histories, an agent can demonstrate that they have acted in accordance with their obligations and in the best interests of the principal and their family members. These records can also be helpful in case of any disputes or legal matters that may arise.</p>
 <aside class="tip style-important size-small align-none"> <div> <header> <svg class="icon icon-triangle-exclamation" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img"> <use xlink:href="#icon-triangle-exclamation"></use> </svg> <h4>Important Note</h4> </header> <p>An agent shouldn&#8217;t mix their own funds with the principal&#8217;s unless the power of attorney specifically allows it.</p> </div> </aside> 
<p>Actions an agent should keep records of include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial transactions, such as withdrawals, cashed checks, invoices, and receipts;</li>
<li>Purchase and sale of any property;</li>
<li>Accounting of every dollar that goes into or out of the principal&#8217;s accounts;</li>
<li>Medical decisions, including surgical procedures, treatments, and medications;</li>
<li>End-of-life decisions;</li>
<li>Any other pertinent choices made on the principal&#8217;s behalf.</li>
</ul>
 <aside class="tip style-tip size-small align-none"> <div> <header> <svg class="icon icon-lightbulb-on" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img"> <use xlink:href="#icon-lightbulb-on"></use> </svg> <h4>Can a family member override a power of attorney?</h4> </header> <p>If an agent abuses their power or fails to meet their fiduciary duty, the principal&#8217;s family members may override the power of attorney by challenging it in court. However, the process can be prolonged, complex and difficult.</p> </div> </aside> 
<h2>Guidance for the Principal</h2>
<p>While the agent under a power of attorney has obligations towards the principal&#8217;s family members, the person creating the power of attorney —  the principal —  should also try to minimize concerns and establish consensus among their family members.</p>
<h3 id="“”this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”“">Hold Meetings</h3>
<p>One way for the principal to minimize misunderstandings and address concerns is to hold regular meetings involving both the agent and the family members. These meetings provide an opportunity for everyone to express their thoughts, ask questions, and discuss any issues or concerns that may arise.</p>
<p>For a <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/power-of-attorney/medical/">medical power of attorney</a>, meetings would ideally occur after doctors&#8217; visits, with information fresh in the principal&#8217;s mind. In these meetings, discussions should cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>The principal&#8217;s latest health status and any potential risks or complications;</li>
<li>The principal&#8217;s preferences for treatments and medications;</li>
<li>Tasks the principal expects the agent to handle if incapacitation occurs.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a financial power of attorney, meetings would ideally occur in tandem with meetings with accountants or financial advisors. Involved parties should discuss items including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The principal&#8217;s present financial status;</li>
<li>Assets the agent can access and manage if the principal is incapacitated;</li>
<li>Utilization of assets during the principal&#8217;s incapacitation;</li>
<li>The agent&#8217;s specific financial responsibilities;</li>
<li>Major forthcoming financial decisions, such as property sales or inheritances.</li>
<li>To keep the meetings focused and productive, prepare a printed agenda that outlines the topics to be discussed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="“”this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”“">Draft the POA in Detail</h3>
<p>Just like any other legal document, the power of attorney document should be drafted in detail to minimize potential disputes and avoid ambiguities. For clarity, a financial or medical power of attorney should specify:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Medical POA</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>The agent&#8217;s authority in specific medical situations and decision-making boundaries;</li>
<li>The principal&#8217;s desired medical treatments, procedures, medications, and any DNR (do not resuscitate) orders;</li>
<li>Any visitor restrictions during the principal&#8217;s medical treatment or hospital stays;</li>
<li>The principal&#8217;s preferences for facilities or specific medical professionals;</li>
<li>The principal&#8217;s views on <a href="https://www.fairhealthconsumer.org/insurance-basics/your-health-plan/experimental-treatments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experimental treatments</a> or participation in clinical trials.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Financial POA</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>The agent&#8217;s authority in certain financial situations and the extent of control over certain assets;</li>
<li>Specific accounts the agent can access and the conditions for access;</li>
<li>Guidance on the principal&#8217;s payments, account management, debt management, and investment strategies;</li>
<li>Instructions on management, sale, or rental of real estate properties;</li>
<li>Management of the principal&#8217;s tax obligations, filings, and any specific preferences for financial professionals or firms;</li>
<li>Management of insurance policies, annuities, retirement plans, beneficiaries, and any desired changes;</li>
<li>Comprehensive guidelines for regular financial reporting and audit.</li>
</ul>
<p>By giving clear instructions in the power of attorney, the principal ensures their intentions are understood, setting a foundation for the agent&#8217;s duties and minimizing potential family conflicts.</p>
<h3 id="“”this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”“">Periodic Reviews</h3>
<p>As life circumstances change, it is important for the principal to periodically review their power of attorney document, make any necessary updates or revisions, and inform their family members and agents. Certain life events may evoke the need to amend a power of attorney, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marriage or divorce;</li>
<li>Birth or adoption of a child;</li>
<li>Death of the designated agent or a named successor agent;</li>
<li>Changes in financial status or acquisition of significant assets;</li>
<li>Moving to a different state or country with differing legal requirements;</li>
<li>Changes in the principal&#8217;s health condition;</li>
<li>Establishment of a trust or changes to an existing one;</li>
<li>Significant changes in tax laws or other regulations that impact the principal&#8217;s assets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When an agent acts under a power of attorney, they not only bear responsibility for the principal but also uphold power of attorney obligations to family members. They often hold the principal&#8217;s life and the lives of their family members in their hands. The agent can only work best and eliminate family members&#8217; concerns when the principal establishes clear communication and has a well-drafted power of attorney.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Empowering someone with the legal authority to make decisions on your behalf requires careful thought and evaluation. When selecting an agent for your <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/power-of-attorney/">power of attorney</a>, it&#8217;s crucial to select someone who embodies trustworthiness, understanding, and the capability to represent your interests.</p>
<p>Dive in to learn about how to choose a power of attorney agent to best manage your affairs.</p>

<h2>What Is an Agent?</h2>
<p>An agent is someone appointed by the principal, the creator of the power of attorney (POA), with the legal authority to act and make decisions on behalf of the principal.</p>
<p>Depending on the POA type, agents are designated to handle medical, legal, personal, and financial affairs when the principal becomes incapacitated or unable to do so themselves.</p>
<h2>Who Can Be an Agent?</h2>
<p>To be named an agent, an individual must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>18 years of age or older;</li>
<li>Of sound mind and have mental capacity;</li>
<li>Willing to act as a fiduciary and protect your rights and interests as the principal.</li>
</ul>
<p>While individual states might have additional criteria (e.g., some states forbid an agent to also be a witness of your POA), the core requirement is a mentally capable adult ready to uphold the principal&#8217;s rights and interests.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53312" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/What-is-an-Agent.png" alt="What is an Agent" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/What-is-an-Agent.png 1024w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/What-is-an-Agent-300x225.png 300w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/What-is-an-Agent-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
 <aside class="tip style-tip size-small align-none"> <div> <header> <svg class="icon icon-lightbulb-on" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img"> <use xlink:href="#icon-lightbulb-on"></use> </svg> <h4>Should I pay my agent?</h4> </header> <p>Legally, you&#8217;re not obliged to pay an agent. When appointing family or friends, many principals opt not to compensate. However, if you choose an attorney or a third party as your agent, expect to pay. Attorneys typically charge hourly ($150-$500) or have flat fees for their services.</p> </div> </aside> 
<h2>Who Should Be Your Power of Attorney Agent: 7 Characteristics to Look for</h2>
<p>Many people choose their spouse to act as their agent. Other common options include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Siblings or close relatives;</li>
<li>Parents or children;</li>
<li>Close friends;</li>
<li>A licensed attorney;</li>
<li>Any other trusted individual.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider the seven characteristics below to pick the right agent for your POA:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-54912 size-full" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/how-to-choose-a-power-of-attorney-1.png" alt="how to choose a power of attorney" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/how-to-choose-a-power-of-attorney-1.png 1024w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/how-to-choose-a-power-of-attorney-1-300x225.png 300w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/how-to-choose-a-power-of-attorney-1-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3 id="“”this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”“">#1: Trustworthiness</h3>
<p>Trustworthiness stands at the core of selecting an agent, especially when the POA grants broad and sweeping powers to the agent, giving them comprehensive control over personal assets or critical end-of-life treatment decisions. Entrusting these sensitive matters to someone trustworthy ensures your wishes are upheld with integrity, even during the most vulnerable moments.</p>
 <aside class="tip style-tip size-small align-none"> <div> <header> <svg class="icon icon-lightbulb-on" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img"> <use xlink:href="#icon-lightbulb-on"></use> </svg> <h4>Fiduciary Duty</h4> </header> <p>Your agent has <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fiduciary_duty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fiduciary duties</a> of care, loyalty, and good faith. This means they are legally obligated to act in your best interest, avoid conflicts of interest, and execute decisions with utmost transparency and honesty. They must prioritize your well-being and financial health above any personal gains or external influences.</p> </div> </aside> 
<h3 id="“”this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”“">#2: Availability</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s vital to select someone both physically accessible and mentally equipped to handle the responsibilities entrusted to them.</p>
<p>Choosing someone nearby ensures they can manage local matters promptly. Additionally, consider age and mental capability. While your 18-year-old son might be legally eligible, he may lack the maturity or experience needed for crucial decisions.</p>
<h3 id="“”this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”“">#3: Shared Values</h3>
<p>Choose a POA agent who aligns with your core beliefs, especially regarding finances and medical preferences. Conflicts may arise if you&#8217;re passionate about organ donation, but your agent opposes it. An agent who deeply understands and respects your values will best represent your wishes.</p>
<h3 id="“”this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”“">#4: Assertiveness</h3>
<p>In challenging situations or disagreements, a POA agent&#8217;s assertiveness is crucial. They must be resilient, standing firm against external pressures—even if decisions are unpopular with others or family members. This ensures your wishes are upheld without compromise.</p>
<h3 id="“”this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”“">#5: Informed Awareness</h3>
<p>An ideal POA agent possesses comprehensive knowledge of your financial and medical circumstances. These can include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medical:</strong> Allergies, medications, and pre-existing conditions;</li>
<li><strong>Financial:</strong> Assets, investments, and debts;</li>
<li><strong>Insurance:</strong> Types and details of coverage;</li>
<li><strong>Legal:</strong> Wills, trusts, and other POA agreements.</li>
</ul>
<p>They must be well-informed to make decisions that genuinely reflect your best interests and unique situation.</p>
<h3 id="“”this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”“">#6: Organizational Skills and Rationality</h3>
<p>An ideal agent must have strong organizational skills and rational thinking to ensure that your directives are understood and executed precisely. They must be able to detach from overwhelming emotions, especially during difficult end-of-life decisions, to secure your desired outcomes.</p>
<h3 id="“”this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”“">#7: Willingness</h3>
<p>Last but not least — choose someone who is genuinely willing to serve as your agent. Ensure your selected individual is not only capable but also truly ready to shoulder the responsibilities and act in your best interest when the time comes.</p>
<h2>Can I Have More Than One Agent?</h2>
<p>If you have more than one POA, you can name a different agent (or agents) for each POA document; the agent(s) can be granted specific authority over certain subjects based on your wishes. For instance, you can appoint your spouse to be your agent under a medical POA and appoint your child to be your agent under a financial or general POA.</p>
<p>If you have only one POA, you can have more than one agent by naming co-agents, or prepare a backup plan by naming a successor agent.</p>
<h3 id="“”this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”“">Successor Agent</h3>
<p>A successor agent serves as an essential backup, stepping in only when the initial agent becomes unable or unavailable to serve.</p>
<p>Appointing a successor agent ensures that your affairs remain in trusted hands. It helps you prepare for unforeseen circumstances and makes sure decisions stay in line with what you want. If there is no named successor agent when the primary agent is unavailable, then the power of attorney ends, or a guardian may be appointed by the court to handle your affairs.</p>
<p>When drafting your power of attorney document, you should designate both an initial and successor agent.</p>
<h3 id="“”this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”“">Co-Agents</h3>
<p>Co-agents are individuals you appoint simultaneously to make decisions for you. Unlike a successor agent, co-agents hold shared authority right from the POA’s activation. You determine whether the co-agents can exercise their powers separately or if the co-agents are required to act together.</p>
<p>Having co-agents can be advantageous, especially if one lives nearby for immediate concerns while the other has expertise in financial or medical matters. However, it has potential pitfalls. Disagreements among the co-agents may lead to legal disputes or your wishes being sidelined.</p>
<h2>How Do I Change My Agent?</h2>
<p>You may want to change your agent for various reasons. They may have changed their mind and can no longer serve in the role, they may have passed away, or you may have second thoughts.</p>
<p>To change your agent and terminate the agent&#8217;s authority, you can <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/power-of-attorney/revocation/">revoke your existing power of attorney</a>. Then, draft a new POA and appoint a new agent on the document.</p>
<h2>Pick the Right Agent for Yourself</h2>
<p>Choosing the right power of attorney agent is vital. Ensure that trust and capability are at the forefront of your decision. By making a thoughtful choice, you safeguard your wishes and interests, especially during unpredictable events.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/power-of-attorney/">power of attorney</a> (POA) allows you (the principal) to designate someone—known as the <em>agent </em>or <em>attorney-in-fact</em>—to make decisions on your behalf should you be unavailable or determined mentally incapacitated. From healthcare to finances, a well-crafted POA provides peace of mind, knowing your affairs will be in trusted hands.</p>
<p>But what exactly can your appointed agent do, and what are the limitations? Let&#8217;s explore this further to make sure your POA covers precisely what you need it to.</p>
<h2><strong><span data-color="transparent">Rights You Can Grant</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Whether you grant your agent limited or broad powers, understanding what financial and medical matters you can legally authorize them to handle is crucial when creating your power of attorney document. </span></p>
<p><span data-color="transparent">Here are some areas you can authorize depending on the type of power of attorney:</span></p>
<h3><strong><span data-color="transparent">Medical Power of Attorney</span></strong></h3>

<h3><strong><span data-color="transparent">Financial Power of Attorney</span></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Everyday Living Expenses. </span></strong><span data-color="transparent">Your agent can use your assets to handle day-to-day tasks, including paying bills and buying groceries.</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Benefits Management.</span></strong><span data-color="transparent"> If you have Social Security, Medicare, veteran&#8217;s benefits, or other government benefits, your agent may manage those benefits and decide how those benefits should be spent. They can also apply for benefits on your behalf.</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Business and Investment Decisions.</span></strong><span data-color="transparent"> Your agent can make business and investment decisions on your behalf.</span></li>

<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Taxes</span></strong><span data-color="transparent">. Agents may handle tax matters, including filing tax returns and paying taxes, on behalf of the principal. </span></li>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Retirement Accounts.</span></strong><span data-color="transparent"> If you have any retirement savings accounts, you can authorize your agent to manage and determine how to use those assets.</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Property Management. </span></strong><span data-color="transparent">Your agent can manage your real property (e.g., sell property, collect rent). </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><span data-color="transparent">Other General Decisions </span></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Lawsuits.</span></strong><span data-color="transparent"> Your agent can file a lawsuit on your behalf or respond to a lawsuit on your behalf when needed. </span></li>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Legal Documents.</span></strong><span data-color="transparent"> Your agent can draft and sign necessary legal documents if you cannot be physically present.</span></li>

<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Housing Needs.</span></strong><span data-color="transparent"> Your agent can make housing decisions for you, such as moving you into a care facility or a home with family. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><span data-color="transparent">Limitations on Your Agent</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-color="transparent">There are certain limitations on what an agent has authority to do under a power of attorney, such as:</span></p>
<h3><strong><span data-color="transparent">Legal Limitation</span></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">After-Death Affairs.</span></strong><span data-color="transparent"> Once the principal dies, the power of attorney is no longer valid. An agent has no legal authority to manage your estate after your death unless they are appointed administrator or executor of your </span><a href="https://legaltemplates.net/resources/estate-planning/living-will-vs-power-of-attorney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-color="transparent"><u>will</u></span></a><span data-color="transparent">. The power of attorney agent may petition the court to become the estate executor if you die without a will.</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Will Management. </span></strong><span data-color="transparent">Even while you are alive, your POA agent is not authorized to change your will. They also cannot invalidate your will.</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Inheritances.</span></strong><span data-color="transparent"> Again, the power of attorney becomes null and void after your death. As such, your agent cannot distribute inheritances or assets unless they are the executor of your will or administrator of your estate.</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Transfer of Power of Attorney. </span></strong><span data-color="transparent">Your agent cannot transfer the power of attorney to anyone else. An agent may decline the appointment under a power of attorney but cannot grant authority to someone else. They can be held legally responsible if they attempt to do so.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><span data-color="transparent">Financial Limitations</span></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Personal Spending. </span></strong><span data-color="transparent">Your agent may not use your assets to make unnecessary purchases for themselves. They are given the ability to access your financial assets and manage financial affairs on your behalf. Still, if it is proved that they use those assets for their benefit instead, the court may remove the power of attorney agent.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><span data-color="transparent">Medical Limitations</span></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Euthanasia. </span></strong><span data-color="transparent">Your agent cannot authorize you to be euthanized.</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Medical Decisions While You Are Conscious and Of Sound Mind. </span></strong><span data-color="transparent">The purpose of your power of attorney is to have an agent make decisions on your behalf when you cannot. However, if you are conscious and of sound mind, you can still make those decisions. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><span data-color="transparent">Ethical and Moral Limitations</span></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Acting Against Fiduciary Duties. </span></strong><span data-color="transparent">Your agent has a responsibility to act in your best interests. This, in law, is referred to as a fiduciary duty. If your agent actively acts against your interests or fails to act, they are in breach of their fiduciary duties. One example would be if your agent places you in a senior care home, learns that you are being abused in that home, and fails to remove you from the situation. In those cases, others (such as family members) may petition the court to remove you as an agent under the power of attorney due to a breach of fiduciary duties.</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Acting Against the Principal&#8217;s Previously Stated Decisions.</span></strong><span data-color="transparent"> Your power of attorney agent is meant to act on your behalf. Suppose you have previously filed a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) form or have stated that you do not want to donate your organs. In that case, your agent is ethically bound to respect those decisions rather than making a different decision for you. </span></li>
<li><strong><span data-color="transparent">Soundness of Mind and Body. </span></strong><span data-color="transparent">The purpose of a power of attorney agent is to act on your behalf and in your best interest when you are not of sound body or mind. Because of this, it&#8217;s crucial to appoint a trustworthy agent who will follow your wishes. If this ceases to be the case, the agent can be removed.</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are numerous legitimate reasons you may have been asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) — and usually, there&#8217;s no issue with signing one. The most common situations include:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Employee NDA</strong>: Employers asking new employees to sign before starting work</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Mutual NDA</strong>: A company asking potential business partners to sign before exchanging confidential information with each other</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Interview NDA</strong>: Employers ask interviewees to sign before interviewing</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Inventor NDA</strong>: An inventor asking potential investors to sign before presenting the invention</p>
<p>But no matter your situation, there are some questions you should ask and answer before signing an NDA.</p>
 <aside class="tip style-tip size-small align-none"> <div> <header> <svg class="icon icon-lightbulb-on" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img"> <use xlink:href="#icon-lightbulb-on"></use> </svg> <h4>Key Takeaways</h4> </header> <ul> <li>Define confidential information clearly for the NDA to be enforceable</li> <li>Consider the nature of the information and the purpose of the NDA when setting the duration</li> <li>Ensure the consequences are unambiguous and reasonable</li> <li>Understand every provision clearly and negotiate on terms you feel uncomfortable with<br /> </div> </aside> </li>

<h2>Why Sign an NDA?</h2>
<p>NDAs (interchangeable with &#8220;confidentiality agreements&#8221;) are common in business relationships—<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=2401781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over one-third of U.S. employees</a> are bound by them. You&#8217;ve likely been asked to sign an NDA because the individual, company, or entity is about to disclose sensitive information, and you&#8217;ll be in a position to learn about and leak that information. In all likelihood, you&#8217;ll have to sign the NDA to move to the next steps of your situation.</p>
<p>For starters, understand exactly <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/non-disclosure-agreement/">what an NDA is and how NDAs work</a>. Then, answer these seven critical questions to ensure that you&#8217;re not putting yourself at more legal liability than necessary and that the deal is fair for both you and the other party.</p>
 <aside class="tip style-tip size-small align-none"> <div> <header> <svg class="icon icon-lightbulb-on" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img"> <use xlink:href="#icon-lightbulb-on"></use> </svg> <h4>Do both parties need to sign an NDA?</h4> </header> <p>In the case of a <strong>unilateral NDA</strong> (or one-way NDA), <strong>only the receiving party</strong>’s information and signature are required.</p> <p><strong>Other types of non-disclosure agreements</strong>, however, require signatures from <strong>both</strong> the disclosing party and the receiving party. This is because both parties involved need to acknowledge the legal liabilities they bear in the confidential relationship.</p> </div> </aside>

<h2>7 Questions to Ask Before Signing an NDA</h2>
<h3 id="“this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”">1. What type of information are you required to keep confidential?</h3>
<p>In 2022, our NDA survey with over 5,000 participants revealed that <strong>94% of disclosing parties</strong> deemed <strong>all</strong> <strong>information</strong> disclosed as &#8220;confidential information&#8221; in their non-disclosure agreements. Nevertheless, such vague language can create confusion for signees.</p>
<p>While the information you should keep confidential won&#8217;t be spelled out in detail, the NDA&#8217;s language <strong>will</strong> list categories of information. For instance, you might be asked to keep customer lists, business plans, trade secrets, or other categories of sensitive information confidential.</p>
<p>Without knowing which information you&#8217;re required to remain confidential, you&#8217;ll risk accidentally leaking the information. Make sure you clearly understand the scope of confidential information; reconfirm with the disclosing party if you have doubts.</p>
<h3 id="“this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”">2. What information is considered &#8220;confidential&#8221;?</h3>
<p>Be wary of language in the non-disclosure agreement that doesn&#8217;t relate to the information you already know personally or publicly. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll handcuff yourself and open yourself up to greater liability — although an NDA with too broad and too vague language is unlikely to hold up in court.</p>
<p>In general, the following types of information should be excluded from non-disclosure agreements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public knowledge</strong> &#8211; Information that is already in the public domain, like on the Internet (i.e., location of Apple headquarters).</li>
<li><strong>Prior Knowledge</strong> &#8211; Information each party already knows before entering the NDA (i.e., the name of a new project the parties will work together for).</li>
<li><strong>Independent Development</strong> &#8211; Each party independently develops information.</li>
<li><strong>Permitted Disclosure</strong> &#8211; The NDA can permit the receiving party to disclose information to certain third parties, like CPAs or attorneys.</li>
<li><strong>Compelled Disclosure</strong> &#8211; If a court order or government agency requires the disclosure of information, then the NDA cannot prevent them from doing so.</li>
</ul>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37613" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/2-3.png" alt="confidential information vs non-confidential information" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/2-3.png 1024w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/2-3-300x225.png 300w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/2-3-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3 id="“this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”">3. What steps must you take to keep it confidential?</h3>
<p>When you sign an NDA, a confidential relationship is established, which makes you responsible for keeping the information confidential. This means you&#8217;re legally liable if confidential information gets leaked (even if it&#8217;s inadvertent). Some common practices for protecting confidential and proprietary information include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Controlling access to confidential information with passwords, firewalls, and encryption</li>
<li>Keeping confidential documents in lockable storage cabinets</li>
<li>Using shredders to destroy secret documents permanently</li>
<li>Using secure services to deliver confidential documents, if necessary</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="“this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”">4. How long will the NDA last?</h3>
<p>The NDA should explicitly state when the agreement to protect the confidential information begins (the &#8220;Effective Date&#8221; ) and the duration in which the information can&#8217;t be shared with others (the &#8220;Disclosure Period,&#8221; or period of confidentiality). In addition, the parties involved usually agree on when the agreement will end (the &#8220;Termination&#8221; provision).</p>
<p>Our NDA survey in 2022 revealed that <strong>more than 80% of NDAs</strong> created required the signees to <strong>maintain confidentiality indefinitely</strong> (forever). This is a legitimate practice for some types of confidential information, like trade secrets (such as KFC&#8217;s chicken recipe).</p>
<p>However, not all types of confidential information require such extensive protection. Some information may lose its value over the passing of time. For instance, a company&#8217;s financial information from 10 years ago may not be regarded as confidential now, as the information has become less relevant.</p>
<p>Having information protected for a long time can be mentally draining and costly. In addition, you&#8217;ll be exposing yourself to more legal liability than necessary if the confidentiality period seems excessively long for the type of information being shared. Find out if any provisions in your NDA are perpetually enforceable (meaning they last forever), and consult with an attorney if you have concerns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37614" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/3-2.png" alt="Real-life examples of period of exchange vs period of confidentiality" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/3-2.png 1024w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/3-2-300x225.png 300w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/3-2-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3 id="“this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”">5. What additional restrictions are in place?</h3>
<p>Read the NDA carefully (as you would with any legal document) to see if any additional provisions may restrain you from certain actions. Commonly seen provisions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/non-compete-agreement/">non-compete</a> clause</strong>. If you have access to a company&#8217;s proprietary information, the company may include a non-compete clause that limits you from working for a competing business to maintain its competitive advantage.</li>
<li><strong>A non-solicitation clause</strong>. If you receive client information from a company, the company may add a non-solicitation clause in the NDA so that you are prohibited from enticing (&#8220;soliciting&#8221;) clients for personal gains.</li>
<li><strong>A non-circumvention clause</strong>. If you act as an intermediary for a company in a supply chain, the company may include a non-circumvention clause that prevents you from bypassing it and contacting its end customers directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2022 NDA survey found that <strong>more than 60% of NDAs</strong> included non-compete and non-solicit provisions.</p>
 <aside class="tip style-tip size-small align-none"> <div> <header> <svg class="icon icon-lightbulb-on" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img"> <use xlink:href="#icon-lightbulb-on"></use> </svg> <h4>The controversy on non-compete clauses</h4> </header> <p>In some states, such as <a href="https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/workplace-policies/non-compete-agreements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington</a>, certain thresholds or conditions must be met to enforce the non-compete clause. Some other states like California deem non-compete clauses <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-reminds-employers-and-workers-noncompete-agreements-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entirely unenforceable</a>. In addition, the FTC has proposed a new rule to <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/01/ftc-proposes-rule-ban-noncompete-clauses-which-hurt-workers-harm-competition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ban non-compete clauses completely</a> as they &#8220;suppress wages, hamper innovation, and block entrepreneurs from starting new businesses.&#8221;</p> </div> </aside> 
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37677" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/14.png" alt="Common clauses in an NDA" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/14.png 1024w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/14-300x225.png 300w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/14-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3 id="“this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”">6. What are the consequences of breaching the NDA?</h3>
<p>Remember that an NDA is a legally enforceable contract, meaning that repercussions can follow in the case of a breach.</p>
<p>Check for any unusually harsh or unfair punishments if you fail to keep the confidential information secret. If the punishment is disproportionate to the breach, hold off on signing. Common consequences for breaking an NDA, other than facing legal action, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being forced to pay damages for the disclosing party&#8217;s monetary loss associated with the breached NDA</li>
<li>Paying punitive damages because your leak was deemed malicious in court</li>
<li>Being restrained from certain actions by an <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/injunctive_relief" target="_blank" rel="noopener">injunctive relief</a></li>
<li>Losing business opportunities, as the breach can harm your reputation (particularly if the breach involves sensitive or proprietary information)</li>
<li>Losing the business relationship with the disclosing party</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #2f4ed0;">► <em>READ MORE:</em></span> <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/resources/business/handling-confidentiality-breach/">How to Effectively Handle a Breach of Confidentiality</a></p>
<p>If you see a liquidated damages provision, be wary. This provision ensures that if you breach the NDA, the company or employer will be entitled to a specific amount of damages—without needing to prove you caused actual damage to them.</p>
<p>However, if the liquidated damages are deemed to be an unenforceable penalty rather than a reasonable estimate of the actual damages that would be incurred in the event of a breach, then the provision may not be enforceable. In that case, the party seeking to recover damages would have to prove the damages suffered due to the breach.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the enforceability of liquidated damages provisions can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific language used in the NDA.</p>
<h3 id="“this_is_whats_gonna_show_in_ToC”">7. Is there anything on the NDA that you don&#8217;t feel comfortable with?</h3>
<p>If you discover (after reading this piece) that there are some red flags in the non-disclosure agreement you&#8217;ve been given, ask to modify the document. While you may not win on every point — there may be good reasons for the document&#8217;s existing language — it can&#8217;t hurt to ask.</p>
 <aside class="tip style-tip size-small align-none"> <div> <header> <svg class="icon icon-lightbulb-on" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img"> <use xlink:href="#icon-lightbulb-on"></use> </svg> <h4>What happens if you refuse to sign an NDA?</h4> </header> <p>An NDA serves the purpose of protecting confidential information during the term of a (potential) business relationship. If you refuse to sign an NDA, the other party will likely terminate the relationship you share. For example, an employer has the right to refuse to hire an individual if the individual says no to signing an employee NDA.</p> </div> </aside> 
<h2>To Sign or Not to Sign</h2>
<p>Signing a non-disclosure agreement can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, you demonstrate a willingness to commit and protect the disclosing party&#8217;s confidential information, establishing trust in the relationship. On the other hand, you bear a heavy burden and fiduciary duty of maintaining confidentiality. Ultimately, you should only sign an NDA after carefully reading the agreement and weighing the particular circumstances and potential risks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Living that sweet summer life usually means two things: sunshine and relaxation.</p>
<p>We’d like to add a third to that list—<strong>home maintenance</strong>. Better weather makes it far easier to start tackling home projects, but it adds some pressure too, especially if you have a property you’re wanting to rent out for the season.</p>
<p>Not only can we help with the <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/lease-agreement/vacation-short-term/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lease agreement</a> and <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/resources/real-estate/red-flags-to-look-for-on-a-tenant-background-check/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tenant checks</a> in that regard, but we’ve also put together a full guide on indoor and outdoor summer home maintenance. This might be the season of backyard BBQs and pool parties, but there are also heatwaves and bugs to prep for. In this article, we’ll help you manage all of it.</p>

<h2>Outdoor Home Maintenance Tips</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-34979 size-full" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/woman-doing-outdoor-home-maintenance-in-the-summer.jpg" alt="woman doing outdoor home maintenance in the summer" width="2048" height="1365" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/woman-doing-outdoor-home-maintenance-in-the-summer.jpg 2048w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/woman-doing-outdoor-home-maintenance-in-the-summer-300x200.jpg 300w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/woman-doing-outdoor-home-maintenance-in-the-summer-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/woman-doing-outdoor-home-maintenance-in-the-summer-768x512.jpg 768w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/woman-doing-outdoor-home-maintenance-in-the-summer-1536x1024.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></p>
<p>The best part about the temperatures going up is that outdoor spaces can finally get more use. Before you set up the patio furniture though and invite people over, there are a few outdoor projects you can do to help ensure that your place is looking great and safe for guests.</p>
<p>Here are some key summer home maintenance checks to do on your outdoor areas to ensure your home is ready for summer rentals or gatherings:</p>
<h3>Wash Driveway and Sidewalks</h3>
<p>The winter and spring months may have had you using a snow blower to keep your driveway and sidewalks clear, but now it’s time to wash it down. Driveways and sidewalks can become covered with mold and algae if they’re not cleaned regularly. Not only will this take away from your curb appeal, it can also make areas slippery or hazardous to walk on.</p>
 <aside class="tip style-tip size-small align-none"> <div> <header> <svg class="icon icon-lightbulb-on" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img"> <use xlink:href="#icon-lightbulb-on"></use> </svg> </header> <p>The simplest way to clean driveways and sidewalks is to just scrub the surfaces down. All you’ll need is some eco-friendly soap, hot water, and a hard-wearing sponge that doesn’t have any metal in it (it could cause damage).</p> </div> </aside> 
<p>The next step up from that is pressure washing. You can buy or rent a pressure washer, or just get an attachment for your garden hose that can mimic one. If you’re feeling inspired to do more, we’d recommend using a degreaser for stubborn tire marks and rust stains.</p>
<h3>Summer Lawn and Landscape Care</h3>
<p>The most common mistake that people make with their lawns is thinking that as the temperatures go up, they simply need to water more frequently.</p>
<p>Here’s the summer home maintenance checklist you need to follow instead to get your landscape looking good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Water your lawn more deeply rather than more often and try to make sure that your grass gets at least one inch of water per week (depending on the type, and your climate).</li>
<li>Don’t let the sun steal all that good hydration you’ve added to your garden by watering in the middle of the day. Aim for morning or evening watering sessions.</li>
<li>Adding to that, a drip irrigation system is great for the warmer months as they water plants slowly enough that it doesn’t evaporate or simply run off.</li>
<li>Check your sprinkler heads to see that their filters aren’t clogged and preventing water from getting out.</li>
<li>Make sure to have a <a href="https://www.loveyourlandscape.org/expert-advice/lawn-care/mowing/11-tips-for-more-effective-mowing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strong mowing routine</a> to keep your lawn looking fresh.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other aspects to add to your lawn maintenance and landscape care are de-weeding, clipping back dead parts that didn’t survive winter, and adding a little fertilizer to keep the soil healthy.</p>
<p>Summer is the growing season of most species so now is a great time to add new plants and trees to your space if your exterior areas need sprucing up.</p>
<h3>Maintain Your Pool</h3>
<p>No one wants to swim in green, mucky water so if you’ve got a pool you’d like to use over the summer, these are the things you need to be doing regularly to keep it clean:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trim the Trees:</strong> If you have any trees near your pool, make sure to cut back any overhang that may grow over the summer to avoid added leaves ending up in it.</li>
<li><strong>Use a Skimmer to Remove Dead Leaves and Debris: </strong> Scooping debris off your pool’s surface every day is much easier than trying to remove it once it’s already sunk to the bottom.</li>
<li><strong>Brush Your Pool Walls:</strong> Use a brush to clean the sediment off your pool walls weekly, preferably aiming the dirt toward the man drain so it’s easy to vacuum.</li>
<li><strong>Vacuum the Pool Floor:</strong> An automatic vacuum makes this job easier but whatever machine you have, just make sure to vacuum up the accumulated sediment from the bottom of your pool at least once a week.</li>
<li><strong>Clean Out the Mechanics:</strong> Another weekly task is checking that your pools’ skimmer and filter are clean and free of anything that may clog them. Backwash your filter every week if the pool is being used a lot or when you see that your filter gauge’s reading is higher than normal.</li>
<li><strong>Test the pH and Add Chemicals:</strong> When your pool’s being used frequently, the water’s pH levels need to be tested at least every week. Add chemicals as needed to keep the algae at bay.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bring on the pool parties!</p>
<h3>Ensure Your Porch and Deck Are in Good Condition</h3>
<p>The same basic washing guidelines that we mentioned regarding driveways and sidewalks can be applied to the summer maintenance of your porch and deck too. The only major difference is that a wooden porch needs to be resealed every few years and, if the color has dulled, may need to be stained again.</p>
 <aside class="tip style-tip size-small align-none"> <div> <header> <svg class="icon icon-lightbulb-on" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img"> <use xlink:href="#icon-lightbulb-on"></use> </svg> </header> <p>Over time, wood can swell and shrink so check your porch for any loose nails or screws that may need tightening again. As wood ages, it can also rot, splinter, and come loose so know that you may need to replace or repair a few deck boards.</p> </div> </aside> 
<p>Our last big summer home maintenance tip for your porch and deck is a safety one: check that any necessary railings are secure and repair or replace them as necessary.</p>
<h3>Clean BBQ and Outdoor Cookers</h3>
<p>We wouldn’t dare write a summer home maintenance checklist without mentioning the importance of taking care of your BBQ and outdoor cookers. Cleaning a gas grill versus a charcoal grill is a little different but here are the main points to check off:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your grill is cool to the touch and if it’s a gas grill, completely disconnected, before you start cleaning.</li>
<li>Now it’s time to disassemble and clean. Charcoal grills need to have the ash removed first but otherwise, both grill types need to have the grates taken out and cleaned.</li>
</ul>
<p>To wash them, you just need a grill brush and warm, soapy water. If the grate needs a deep cleaning, you can always leave oven cleaner on it overnight before scrubbing it down with the grill brush.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wipe down the interior and exterior of the grill with hot water and soap.</li>
<li>Replace the grate, get the heat going, and start planning those backyard BBQs for the summer!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Indoor Home Maintenance Tips</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-34980 size-full" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/man-doing-indoor-home-maintenance-in-the-summer.jpg" alt="man doing indoor home maintenance in the summer" width="2048" height="1367" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/man-doing-indoor-home-maintenance-in-the-summer.jpg 2048w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/man-doing-indoor-home-maintenance-in-the-summer-300x200.jpg 300w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/man-doing-indoor-home-maintenance-in-the-summer-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/man-doing-indoor-home-maintenance-in-the-summer-768x513.jpg 768w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/man-doing-indoor-home-maintenance-in-the-summer-1536x1025.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></p>
<p>As much time as we spend outside over the summer months, your indoor areas still need to be in top shape if you’re to survive the bugs, heat, and other less fun parts of the season …</p>
<h3>Clean Air-Conditioning Filters</h3>
<p>There’s a point every year when the summer heat goes from being delightful to straight-up sweaty. When that happens, you’re going to want as much cool air in your home as you can get. What you don’t want however is your air conditioner or central air systems blowing dust and other allergens into your home.</p>
 <aside class="tip style-tip size-small align-none"> <div> <header> <svg class="icon icon-lightbulb-on" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img"> <use xlink:href="#icon-lightbulb-on"></use> </svg> </header> <p>To keep your air as clean as it is cool, make sure to add “clean air-conditioning filters” to your summer home maintenance plan. The best way to clean your filters is to remove them, vacuum and then wash them. A garden hose works well as it has a bit of pressure but never use anything stronger on the filters as they can be quite fragile.</p> </div> </aside> 
<p>Once you’ve reinstalled the filter into your air conditioner, not only will your air be cleaner, but you’ll be helping to ensure that the whole unit functions better for longer. As with so many maintenance tasks, the payoff is usually worth the effort.</p>
<h3>Prevent Bugs and Other Pests in Your Home</h3>
<p>We’re not the only ones who love a bit of warmer weather. There are plenty of bugs and other pests that tend to come out of the woodwork over the season – both figuratively and literally. Here is your summer home maintenance checklist for keeping them out of your home:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower Points of Entry:</strong> The fewer places that bugs can sneak through, the better. Seal your doors with weather stripping and inspect your home for any cracks in door frames and walls needing repairs, or gaps around pipes that need filling with caulk or sealant.</li>
<li><strong>Manage Your Trash:</strong> This is a big summer maintenance must as your garbage disposal system hugely affects pest problems. Exterior garbage bins should be well-sealed and have self-closing lids so they’re less likely to stand open and attract unwanted guests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your garbage disposal should also be done regularly so that nothing is left to rot inside where it could attract flies etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t Let Water Collect:</strong> Mosquitoes are usually the enemy of the summer months as they tend to breed in warm conditions. They lay their eggs in and near water so just make sure that outdoor faucets or irrigation systems aren’t leaking, and that water isn’t gathering in your yard or near the foundations of your property.</li>
<li><strong>Install/Repair Window Screens:</strong> Those with window screens installed already need to inspect them each summer for any gaps that might have developed. If you don’t have them but are struggling with bugs, they’re a highly effective addition worth considering.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Test Smoke Alarms and Carbon Monoxide Detectors</h3>
<p>No matter what time of year we’re dealing with or what the weather looks like, your maintenance checklist always needs to include a point to inspect and test any smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors. Especially if you’re looking at <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/lease-agreement/vacation-short-term/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renting out</a> a summer home, there may be legal implications for not doing proper inspections, depending on the state.</p>
<p>All detectors have a “test” button that you can press to check that it beeps or lets off a siren as guided by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>You can also “crisis” test your smoke alarms by placing something smokey beneath them to see that they go off appropriately. When it comes to fire administration and health risks, smoke and carbon monoxide aren’t things to be ignored.</p>
<h3>Plan for Heat Waves</h3>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-heat-waves" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2022 report</a> from the EPA, heatwaves are occurring far more frequently in cities across the US, lasting for longer and becoming more intense over time. What that means for your summer home maintenance checklist is that planning for heat waves is now a must.</p>

<p>If your home isn’t adjusted to these extreme instances of heat, it can expose the people in it to health risks, especially those with heart issues. To be more proactive about heatwaves, pay attention to these maintenance tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A nice breeze won’t be enough to cool you down in a heat wave.</strong> Inspect any ceiling fans, air conditioning units, fridges, and freezers to ensure that they are in good working order. Both you and your food need to be kept cool through intense temperature spikes.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure your ceiling fans turn counterclockwise so that they move the cool air downward and not up.</strong> However, it must be noted that if temperatures rise <a href="https://www.ready.gov/heat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">above 90 degrees</a>, your ceiling fan could simply be dehydrating you rather than lowering your body temperature.</li>
<li><strong>Have curtains or some kind of cover ready for any windows that get sun.</strong> The darker you can keep your home during the day, the cooler it will stay.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wash the Exterior Windows</h3>
<p>One of the best home maintenance tips we can give is also one the most obvious: clean your windows. Having clean exterior windows and glass sliding doors makes a world of difference to your home, especially in summer. What’s the point of nice weather and getting your garden in order if you can’t see out to enjoy it?</p>
<p>A bit of water, soap, and a good microfiber cloth or mop can get your exterior windows sparkling.</p>
<h3>Maintain Your Bathrooms</h3>
<p>This isn’t necessarily a summer-specific maintenance task, but it is one that you have to pay added attention to as things get warmer as it’s likely to inspire the growth of more mildew and mold in bathrooms.</p>
<p>For that reason, inspect your exhaust fan to see that it still works, and then clean any grime that’s collected with a damp cloth so that it can function properly. Those fans do a lot to keep moisture at bay and should make your life far easier by minimizing how often you have to deal with mold issues.</p>
<p>If the problem you’re facing is bad water pressure in the shower, it’s usually a sign that either the water heater needs to be seen to, or you just need to clean out the shower head. A toothbrush and vinegar usually work best for cleaning out mineral deposits in a shower head that could be plugging water flow.</p>

<h2>Summer Maintenance FAQs</h2>
<p>Quickfire answers to the questions we’ve seen you asking:</p>
<h3>How Do You Take Care of a Summer House?</h3>
<p>Take all the suggestions we’ve given so far and add a few more, including checking gutters for blockages, inspecting the roof for any leaks or issues, and generally doing a mold check throughout. These issues are especially important if the property has been shut up for a while.</p>
<h3>How Do You Maintain a Seasonal House?</h3>
<p>As with the previous question, this summer home maintenance checklist is a great place to start. The main trick is to simply put aside the necessary time and get it done, no matter how tedious it may seem.</p>
<p>To lessen the repairs and maintenance needed between seasons, you can also do things like making sure the pool is covered from early fall and that the home is well-sealed. That way you’re less likely to find unwanted surprises upon your return.</p>
<h3>What Is Normal Maintenance on a House?</h3>
<p>It all depends on the house but generally, every property needs to have its exterior and interior spaces inspected for things that are either causing an eyesore (like dirty exterior windows) or simply aren’t functioning properly and could cause damage to the house (blocked gutters and a damaged roof).</p>
<h2>The Point of Doing Home Maintenance Task</h2>
<p>The bottom line is that the more you do to keep your home in order, the less likely that costly damage will occur or that the look of the place will degrade.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you’re just wanting to keep your house looking great for summer parties, or if your goal is to attract renters, ticking off everything on your summer home maintenance checklist is a worthwhile investment.</p>
<p>Another great investment? Renting out your home for the season. Whether you’re new to the game, or a long-experienced landlord, the products and team at NyAi are here to <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assist</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are ways for landlords and tenants alike to stay cool as the weather heats up in the summer months. From home improvements to using your fans and curtains correctly, you can keep the summer heat outside the house while circulating cool air indoors.</p>
<p>Here are 25 tips and tricks to keep your home cool this summer.</p>
 <aside class="tip style-tip size-small align-none"> <div> <header> <svg class="icon icon-lightbulb-on" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img"> <use xlink:href="#icon-lightbulb-on"></use> </svg> <h4>Key Takeaways</h4> </header> <ul> <li>Keeping your house cool saves electricity and money all summer</li> <li>Sealing and insulating your home to keep the heat out and the cold in</li> <li>Air quality and air movement increase summer comfort</li> </ul> </div> </aside> 

<h2>Seal the Exterior</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-34928 size-full" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/tips-for-sealing-the-exterior-of-your-home.png" alt="tips for sealing the exterior of your home" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/tips-for-sealing-the-exterior-of-your-home.png 1080w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/tips-for-sealing-the-exterior-of-your-home-300x300.png 300w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/tips-for-sealing-the-exterior-of-your-home-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/tips-for-sealing-the-exterior-of-your-home-150x150.png 150w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/tips-for-sealing-the-exterior-of-your-home-768x768.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<p>Sealing up and insulating is the most effective method to keep your house cool in the summer. You want to keep warm air from getting in, keep cold air from getting out, and prevent heat from transferring through the materials of your home through insulation.</p>
<p>This can be done with several home improvement projects ranging from easy DIY to professional repairs and renovations.</p>
<h3>1. Re-Caulk Loose Windows</h3>
<p>With nothing more than a caulk gun and a sealant tube, you can seal up rattling windows and cracked window frames to stop unwanted air transfer. Double-paned windows that rattle provide extra insulation once resealed but will need full window replacement to regain the full effect of gas-insulated windows.</p>
<h3>2. Replace Weather Stripping Around Exterior Doors</h3>
<p>Exterior doors are sealed with weather stripping, flexible strips of rubber, and fabric that seal the doors when closed and flex so the doors can open. These strips wear out and must be replaced every 2-5 years, so you may lose AC through leaks and not realize that your weather stripping is old. It&#8217;s a simple project to remove old weatherstripping and attach new strips to each external door.</p>
<h3>3. Have Your Siding Inspected and Repaired</h3>
<p>Gaps or damage to your external structure can also let hot air in or cold air out. Have your siding inspected for damage and repaired if necessary. Seal gaps or cracks in your home&#8217;s interior structure to keep your AC inside instead of escaping into the hot spaces between the walls.</p>
<h3>4. Upgrade Your Insulation</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a project that will significantly improve your home&#8217;s cool in the summer and <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/resources/holiday-tips-for-landlords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warmth in the winter</a>, upgrade your insulation. You can better insulate the attic easily and add better insulation between the walls whenever a renovation is underway. This will prevent heat, cold, and even sound from transmitting between the walls and floors of your home.</p>
<h2>Take Care of Your Air Conditioner</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-34873 size-full" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/checklist-for-summer-AC-maintenance.png" alt="checklist for summer AC maintenance" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/checklist-for-summer-AC-maintenance.png 1080w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/checklist-for-summer-AC-maintenance-300x300.png 300w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/checklist-for-summer-AC-maintenance-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/checklist-for-summer-AC-maintenance-150x150.png 150w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/checklist-for-summer-AC-maintenance-768x768.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<p>The performance of your air conditioner is crucial to evenly distributing cool air through your home and minimizing the energy bill. However, most people don&#8217;t think much about their HVAC units even when the power bills rise and their home struggles to stay cool.</p>
<p>You can improve the performance and efficiency of your air conditioning unit for a cooler summer experience in several ways.</p>
<h3>5. Change Your Air Filter</h3>
<p>Changing the air filters is the first and easiest way to maintain your air conditioner. Filters must be changed every one to three months, depending on your system, region, and dust sources (like pets) inside the house. When your air filter is clogged, your AC loses efficiency. Changing AC filters regularly will improve airflow and keep your air conditioner in good condition.</p>
<h3>6. Optimize with a Smart Thermostat</h3>
<p>Programming your thermostat is one of the best ways to keep the house cool and efficient at the same time. If everyone leaves during the day, you can set your thermostat to warm up while the house is empty and start cooling just before you get home.</p>
<p>Cool the house down efficiently at night and choose a tolerable medium temperature during the day. Smart thermostats can even adapt to peak hours and help you to balance cooling cycles with your daily schedule.</p>
<h3>7. Clear Debris from the Outside AC Unit</h3>
<p>If you want to improve efficiency from the outside in, check on the outdoor unit of your AC system. Clear away any brush and debris from the vents and, if you see any dented fins or a great deal of dirt buildup, a technician can sort it out for you.</p>
<h3>8. Book Your Annual HVAC Maintenance &amp; Cleaning</h3>
<p>Speaking of HVAC technicians, every HVAC system needs an annual maintenance visit for cleaning, tune-up, and potential repairs. Book yours in the springtime before the heat of summer whenever possible, or in the middle of summer if your AC is not as efficient as it should be. A quick tune-up can significantly improve your AC unit&#8217;s performance and energy efficiency.</p>
<h3>9. Have Your Ducts Cleaned</h3>
<p>Dust builds up inside ducts just like it does on your air filter. Dirty ducts can cause slower airflow and more dust/allergen redistribution through the house. Cleaning your ducts will improve cooling efficiency and indoor air quality for the next two or three years before it&#8217;s time for another cleaning.</p>
<h2>Improve Air Flow</h2>

<p>Air circulation is essential to feel cool and warm your home in searing heat.</p>
<p>Proper ventilation in the attic and airflow in your living spaces can maximize the effect of your AC, cooling the house more evenly and preventing heat from building up where you don&#8217;t want it.</p>
<h3>10. Make Sure the Attic Is Ventilated</h3>
<p>Attic ventilation matters more than most people realize. With the simple air movement through your attic, you can prevent heat from building below your roof and transferring into the rest of the house through the ceiling. Proper attic insulation and a few vents can keep much hot air outside the house.</p>
<h3>11. Switch Ceiling Fans to Spin Counter-Clockwise</h3>
<p>Ceiling fan direction determines what kind of air circulation they provide. Clockwise spin helps to stir warm air during the winter.</p>
<p>Rotating counterclockwise in the summer will create a cool breeze that will keep your home cool without cranking up the AC to low temperatures. Climb up to each of your ceiling fans and flip the switch on the side of the central mechanism. Set the fan at its lowest setting and stand below to determine if the blades are turning in the correct direction.</p>
<h3>12. Keep Interior Doors Open</h3>
<p>While you want to keep your exterior doors and windows shut tight, the doors inside the home should remain open. This promotes even air circulation through the house and makes the best use of your AC cooling vents in each room for an even, comfortable temperature throughout.</p>
<p>Open doors can make a big difference for fresh air and gentle air circulation if your rooms feel stuffy in the summer.</p>
<h3>13. Place Floor Fans in Key Locations</h3>
<p>You can also feel cooler and increase your AC&#8217;s effectiveness with a few strategically placed floor fans.</p>
<p>Fans at the top or bottom of the stairs, at the end of hallways, and blowing through open living spaces can help circulate AC and create a pleasantly cooling breeze within your home. You can adjust the fan speed according to the temperature outside, going at top speed during the hottest part of the day.</p>
<h2>Keep Out the Sunshine</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-36668 aligncenter" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/tips-for-keeping-the-sunshine-out-1024x1024.png" alt="tips-for-keeping-the-sunshine-out" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/tips-for-keeping-the-sunshine-out-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/tips-for-keeping-the-sunshine-out-300x300.png 300w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/tips-for-keeping-the-sunshine-out-150x150.png 150w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/tips-for-keeping-the-sunshine-out-768x768.png 768w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/tips-for-keeping-the-sunshine-out.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Your home absorbs heat in the summer not just from the air but also from the sun&#8217;s rays. The more sunlight hits the house, the warmer your home will become.</p>
<p>Therefore, preventing sunshine from hitting your home&#8217;s roof, windows, and walls can save money and help you keep cool by keeping that ambient heat outdoors.</p>
<h3>14. Hang the Right Summer Curtains</h3>
<p>First, protect your windows from the sun&#8217;s heat pouring in. Light-colored curtains reflect light instead of absorbing it, while cellular or insulated shades create a barrier of air that prevents heat from coming directly indoors.</p>
<p>In extreme heat, insulated window film or even a reflective film can significantly reduce the sun&#8217;s heat through your windows. If you like traditional draperies, use the decorative filmy white curtains facing the outside to deflect light while using heavier and darker colored drapes over these indoors. Or you can choose blackout curtains that block sunlight completely and can even reduce noise coming from outside.</p>
<h3>15. Encourage Leafy Tree Growth</h3>
<p>Trees over your house can keep your house noticeably cooler because you are exposed to far less direct sunlight. If you have tall trees, allow them to grow shadily over your home. If you don&#8217;t have a tree, planting a fast-growing canopy tree now can save your money in summer cooling bills in just a few years of growth.</p>
<h3>16. Mount Awnings Over Windows</h3>
<p>Even without tree cover, you can reduce the heat that hits your home with a few simple awnings. Combining awnings on the outside with the right curtains on the inside is a great way to make sure your windows, especially your south-facing windows, do not become a major source of summer heat.</p>
<p>Awnings or shade sails deflect sunshine onto a thin mesh or canvas fabric instead of allowing the sunlight to make it to your windows or siding.</p>
<h2>Reduce Indoor Heat</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-36621 aligncenter" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/steps-to-reduce-indoor-heat-1-1024x1024.png" alt="steps-to-reduce-indoor-heat" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/steps-to-reduce-indoor-heat-1-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/steps-to-reduce-indoor-heat-1-300x300.png 300w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/steps-to-reduce-indoor-heat-1-150x150.png 150w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/steps-to-reduce-indoor-heat-1-768x768.png 768w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/steps-to-reduce-indoor-heat-1.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Producing less indoor heat is another great way to keep your house cool during summer. You might be surprised to learn just how many ways your home produces unwanted heat and how cool it will feel when you make a few changes.</p>
<h3>17. Skip Oven Meals &#8211; Barbeque Outdoors</h3>
<p>Try to minimize the amount you use the oven and stove when preparing summer meals. The oven, especially, generates a great deal of heat which is nice in the winter but can be sweltering in the summer. Don&#8217;t make your AC work to remove that heat. Instead, take your cooking outdoors to enjoy more summer grilling and barbecues, where the heat will naturally dissipate into the breeze.</p>
<h3>18. Take Cool Refreshing Showers</h3>
<p>Hot showers also aren&#8217;t a necessity most of the time. Not only can you avoid getting your bathroom muggy with steam, but a lukewarm shower is nicely refreshing during a hot summer day. Find the perfect setting for your shower knobs to achieve just the right temperature for midday showers and save the hot showers for late at night when the air has cooled down, and your vent will be more effective.</p>
<h3>19. Run the Big Appliances at Night</h3>
<p>Large appliances also generate a surprising amount of waste heat. Consider running your laundry machines and dishwasher in the evening to avoid building up the heat indoors during hot summer days. Turn off your dishwasher&#8217;s hot drying cycle and open the door to let your dishes dry naturally, especially saving your heated dryer cycles for after dark.</p>
<h3>20. Switch Off Unused Appliances</h3>
<p>You can even reduce the ambient electrical heat of a modern household by fully switching off appliances when they are not in use. Use power strips to disconnect items like your television that may hum in &#8216;standby&#8217; mode when officially switched off and turn off warm computer screens during the day to reduce the heat they add to your home interior.</p>
<h3>21. Take Control of Your Humidity</h3>
<p>Humidity also greatly affects whether your home feels cool during the summer. If the air is too muggy, heat will not dissipate, and a dehumidifier is an answer. If the air is too dry, the air may feel stale and hot, and the mist from a cool humidifier will be refreshing.</p>
<h2>Keep Your Body Cool</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-36736 aligncenter" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/how-to-keep-your-body-cool-in-the-summer-1-1024x1024.png" alt="how-to-keep-your-body-cool-in-the-summer" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/how-to-keep-your-body-cool-in-the-summer-1-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/how-to-keep-your-body-cool-in-the-summer-1-300x300.png 300w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/how-to-keep-your-body-cool-in-the-summer-1-150x150.png 150w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/how-to-keep-your-body-cool-in-the-summer-1-768x768.png 768w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/how-to-keep-your-body-cool-in-the-summer-1.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Lastly, you can increase the perceived efficiency of your home cooling by treating yourself the right way during the summer. Keep your body cool with light clothing, light breezes, and the right bedding to feel cool even as the summer temperatures rise.</p>
<h3>22. Wear Light, Breezy Clothing</h3>
<p>Switch to summer clothing and experiment with light, breezy styles. Make sure your clothes are made of breathable materials—even t-shirts and tanks can be too heavy in the summer if made incorrectly. Consider wearing shorts or skirts more often and swap out your heavy winter socks for light synthetic socks.</p>
<p>Every little bit counts to reduce body heat. You may even want to switch your hairstyle to keep a breeze flowing over your ears and the back of your neck where heat tends to be trapped by winter styles.</p>
<h3>23. Switch to Percale Weave Sheets &amp; a Light Blanket</h3>
<p>Hot sleeping is the bane of warm summer nights. Sleep cooler with the right bedding and bedroom setup. Swap out those flannel sheets for a light and cooling percale weave. Switch your favorite comforter for a light microfiber blanket or a cotton quilt. If you have trouble sleeping with summer-weight bedding, use a weighted blanket that is also breathable, and consider adding a ceiling fan to your bedroom for airflow and white noise.</p>
<h3>24. Create a Misting Fan</h3>
<p>During the day, add a little &#8220;misting&#8221; to a fan or two. Misting is when a fan blows small droplets of water that evaporate off your skin to help you keep cool. Place a block of ice before a fan or spritz clean water from a spray bottle into the fan&#8217;s breeze to help yourself, and others stay cool.</p>
<h3>25. Cool Down at Night</h3>
<p>Cool your house at night when the sun is down, and heat dissipates from the outside air. A cooler nighttime temperature will help you sleep better, and cooling is more efficient during breezy summer evenings. If your region&#8217;s weather is right, you might switch to fan-only and open the windows to welcome cooler night air.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>How do you terminate an employee properly?</strong> The reality is that no one wants to get fired, and no one wants to fire anyone. Unfortunately, there are situations where employees need to be let go, whether due to budget cuts or performance issues.</p>
<p>All situations of firing an employee need to be handled with care. Every scenario is different, particularly if you have an at-will employee who might not have a detailed <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/employment-contract/">employment contract</a>.</p>
<p>Learn how to properly terminate an employee, and have an <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/employee/write-up/termination-letter/">employment termination letter</a> ready to expedite the process and protect yourself.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-32139 size-full" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Three-people-in-a-business-meeting-706-471-min.jpg" alt="Three people in a business meeting" width="706" height="471" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Three-people-in-a-business-meeting-706-471-min.jpg 706w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Three-people-in-a-business-meeting-706-471-min-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px" /></p>
<h2><strong>6 Steps to Terminate an Employee</strong></h2>
<p>If you are interested in how to terminate an employee, keep in mind that every situation is different. You will need to tailor the process to meet your specific situation, but there are a few steps you need to follow. They include:</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1 &#8211; Document Everything</strong></h3>
<p>First, you must make sure that you <strong>document everything</strong>. There is a saying that if you don&#8217;t document it, it is like it never happened. You do not want to be accused of unfairly or inappropriately firing an employee, so you need to document evidence supporting your reasons for firing the employee.</p>
<p>For example, you might want to create a paper trail of mistakes, <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/employee-evaluation/">employee evaluation forms</a>, issues, and past failures by the employee. Of course, you should also give the employee an opportunity to improve if he or she has not done anything to harm the company intentionally.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 2 &#8211; Consult Your Management Teams</strong></h3>
<p>Before you terminate an employee, you need to consult with your management teams. In particular, you need to <strong>meet with your human resources and legal departments</strong>. Your human resources team will review the employee’s history and employment contract to see if there are any specific violations. Your legal team will also protect the company when you proceed with the termination process and help avoid a wrongful termination lawsuit.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3 &#8211; Schedule a Meeting</strong></h3>
<p><strong>You must schedule a meeting with the employee to terminate them in person</strong>. You need to think carefully about how this process will take place. Ideally, it should be done privately, but you might want a witness to sit in on the termination meeting and support your version of the events.</p>
<p>You should also try to schedule the meeting at the end of the day when it&#8217;s quieter, and there are fewer people around. That way, you don&#8217;t have to worry about a fired employee feeling exposed to his or her coworkers after a difficult meeting. Having the meeting at the end of the day will avoid unnecessary questions and prying eyes, as there are fewer people around</p>
<h3><strong>Step 4 &#8211; Prepare for the Meeting</strong></h3>
<p>Before the date of the meeting, you need to <strong>prepare accordingly</strong>. Make sure you have a script in mind and consider bringing evidence of all of the issues to the meeting with the employee. You probably do not want the meeting to go on too long, but you need to anticipate potential questions from the employee. You should also speak with your human resources and legal teams once again to make sure you do not overlook anything that has to be mentioned during the meeting.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <aside class="tip style-important size-small align-none"> <div> <header> <svg class="icon icon-triangle-exclamation" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img"> <use xlink:href="#icon-triangle-exclamation"></use> </svg> <h4>IMPORTANT: NON-COMPETE</h4> </header> <p>Check with your HR and legal teams if there are <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/non-compete-agreement/">non-compete agreements</a> or clauses that the employee is bound to post-employment. If so, take the original documents to reiterate the main restrictions with the employee. You may even want the employee to sign an off-boarding checklist confirming what was discussed in the termination meeting.</p> </div> </aside> </span></p>
<h3><strong>Step 5 &#8211; Hold the Meeting</strong></h3>
<p>When the meeting takes place, be open and honest with the employee. State why the meeting is taking place, and inform the employee of why he or she is being fired. If the employee is owed a severance package (including unused vacation), explain the severance package and final paycheck in detail, and answer any questions the employee might have to the best of your ability.</p>
<p>If you feel it is appropriate to do so, thank the employee for his or her service, and consider providing options or guidance for future directions the employee might take in his or her career.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-32162 size-large aligncenter" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Termination-Meeting-Tips-Infographic-410x1024.jpg" alt="Termination meeting tips infographic" width="410" height="1024" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Termination-Meeting-Tips-Infographic-410x1024.jpg 410w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Termination-Meeting-Tips-Infographic-120x300.jpg 120w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Termination-Meeting-Tips-Infographic-768x1920.jpg 768w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Termination-Meeting-Tips-Infographic-819x2048.jpg 819w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Termination-Meeting-Tips-Infographic.jpg 1667w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Step 6 &#8211; Gather Any Company Property and Change Security Logins</strong></h3>
<p>Once the meeting is done, <strong>do not forget to close that employee’s account with your company</strong>. Try to delete their account, remove access to the building, and ensure the employee does not have access to confidential information anymore.</p>
<p>You need to move quickly, as you do not want a fired employee to steal the company&#8217;s confidential information as revenge potentially. Do not forget to write the termination to ensure everything is clear, and provide the employee with a termination letter.</p>
<h2><strong>How Not to Terminate an Employee</strong></h2>
<p>You can tailor the above steps to meet the needs of your specific situation, but there are also several common mistakes to avoid.</p>
<p>A few common mistakes that employees and managers make when they terminate an employee include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Firing without reason</strong>: If you are wondering how to terminate an employee without cause, outright firing them is probably not the best way to do so. If you fire an employee without a valid reason, you could set yourself up for a lawsuit for wrongful termination. Always make sure you have a valid reason if you want to fire or terminate an employee.</li>
<li><strong>Firing an employee without a witness</strong>: When you have a termination meeting with an employee, you must always ensure a witness is present. It might be that employee’s manager or a representative from the human resources department. Always have a witness present to avoid false accusations following the meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Firing without warning</strong>: Firing an employee is difficult for everyone involved in the process, but it is even harder when the employee does not see it coming. Always give an employee an opportunity to correct their job performance before you decide to fire them.</li>
<li><strong>Having a meeting that goes on too long</strong>: Firing an employee is emotionally draining for all parties, so try not to let the meeting go on too long. You need to keep the meeting short and sweet. Make sure you answer any questions the employee might have but try not to let the meeting go on too long.</li>
<li><strong>Giving the impression it is not permanent</strong>: Finally, you must ensure the employee understands that the firing is permanent. While you want to be nice, you want to be straightforward. Ensure the employee understands that they are not being suspended but are being terminated.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may want to talk with your human resources team before it is time for the meeting. That way, you can make sure you avoid these mistakes and not set yourself up for possible legal action down the road.</p>
<h2><strong>What to Say in a Termination Meeting</strong></h2>
<p>Because these meetings are so challenging, you might be interested in a sample ‘how to terminate an employee’ script. You can use a few options, and you may need to tweak these scripts to match your situation.</p>
<p>Remember that you may need to alter or change these scripts depending on your situation. That way, the employee understands exactly why they are being fired, and you can keep the meeting short, sweet, and to the point.</p>
<h3><strong>Terminating an Employee for Cause</strong></h3>
<p><em>“While we have given you plenty of opportunities to improve your performance, we continue to field complaints about your conduct from our clients and coworkers. Therefore, we’ve decided to terminate your employment here. Despite our checklists, advice, and supervision, you haven’t improved your performance, so today is your last day. We haven&#8217;t seen the necessary improvements, but thank you for your time at our company. If you have any questions, please ask us.”</em></p>
<h3><strong>Terminating an Employee At-Will</strong></h3>
<p><em>“John, today will be your last day at our company. We are severing your employment at will and will provide you with your COBRA notification and an explanation of how the process works. Thank you for your time and service to our company, but we have decided it is time to move on. We will need to collect all of our company property from your office. Please let us know if you have any questions.”</em></p>
<h2><strong>6 Reasons to Terminate an Employee</strong></h2>
<p>There are several reasons why you might want to terminate an employee. <strong>You need a valid reason for terminating an employee, as you want to avoid any potential legal action.</strong></p>
<p>A few examples of reasons why you might decide to terminate an employee include:</p>
<h3><strong>Insubordination</strong></h3>
<p>Everyone needs to understand the chain of command, and there might be situations where you have an employee guilty of insubordination. Perhaps they have outright refused to listen to their superiors or willfully disobeyed orders one too many times. Insubordination is a common reason why you might need to terminate an employee.</p>
<h3><strong>Tardiness and Absences</strong></h3>
<p>You may also need to terminate an employee due to tardiness or repeated absences. Your company has difficulty staying on track if people are late or missing. If an employee has a habit of being late or missing work without notifying anyone, you may need to terminate them.</p>
<h3><strong>Poor Performance</strong></h3>
<p>In some situations, employees genuinely try their best, but their performance is not good enough. But how to terminate an employee for poor performance? You might want to take some time to guide your employees on how they can improve; using an <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/resources/business/effective-performance-appraisal-methods/">effective performance appraisal method</a> can help. But if the quality of their work does not advance, you may need to move forward with the termination process.</p>
<h3><strong>Theft</strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes, employees are guilty of crimes during their time at the company. If you believe an employee is stealing from the company, particularly if you have a paper trail on a company card, you may want to move forward with the termination process. You might even need to notify law enforcement.</p>
<h3><strong>Harassment and Violence</strong></h3>
<p>Harassment and violence should never be tolerated in the workplace. If you have fielded multiple complaints from clients or coworkers, regardless of whether it is physical violence, verbal abuse, or sexual harassment, you need to move quickly. This is a reason for terminating an employee immediately.</p>
<h3><strong>Trade Secrets</strong></h3>
<p>If you have evidence that an employee is revealing trade secrets to the public or your competitors, you need to take action quickly. This is a serious situation; you might even need to contact the legal team. You should terminate this employee immediately to protect the company&#8217;s information. You should also conduct a full audit to see what confidential information the company employee might have revealed.</p>
<p>All of these termination reasons can directly impact the revenue and profit generated by the company. Some of them could hurt your company culture, while others could directly threaten the health and safety of your employees, customers, and the company as a whole.</p>
<p>While you might want to terminate these employees as quickly as possible, you need to go through the process, working with your HR and legal teams. That way, you make sure the company is protected, and you also ensure there is a valid reason for firing the employee.</p>
<p>Remember to expedite the process by having an <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/employee/write-up/termination-letter/#employment-termination-letter-template">employment termination letter template</a> ready. That way, you can schedule the meeting as soon as possible and allow everyone to move on with their lives.</p>

<h2>2023 U.S. Housing Market Outlook</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re all wondering: <strong>where is the real estate market heading?</strong> Economic indicators give us a glimpse.</p>
<p>As of November 2022, the Conference Board Leading Economic Index (LEI) <a href="https://www.conference-board.org/topics/us-leading-indicators" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had fallen for nine months in a row</a>, indicating an ever-worsening economy. More specifically, it is reported that &#8220;only stock prices contributed positively&#8221; to the index and that many other indicators—including housing—have yet to recover economically.</p>
<p>Despite inflation slowing down and mortgage rates declining gradually, affordability remains a tough issue. According to <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/research-and-insights/forecast/housing-and-mortgage-markets-declined-significantly-2022-not-expected-meaningfully-recover-until" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA)</a>, purchasing a median-priced existing home with the median household income at current mortgage rates is the most financially challenging ever since the great financial crisis. With many other negative factors in consideration, FNMA predicts &#8220;continued declines in existing sales&#8221; next year.</p>
<p>For renters and landlords, that may mean renters who had otherwise planned to purchase a home may hunker down and wait for the market and mortgage rates to stabilize more.</p>
<p>So, what can landlords do to meet this demand? We&#8217;ve identified eight emerging trends that will shape the dynamic between landlords and tenants in the coming months.</p>
<h2>A Quick Glimpse: 2021-2022</h2>
<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/1789020"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
<h2 data-src="story/1789020">Trend #1: Will Rent Go Down in 2023? Probably Not.</h2>
<p data-src="story/1789020">The average rent in the US in 2022 was <strong>$1,218</strong>—over $100 more than that of 2021 ($1,095), an increase that is notable even with inflation into account. As <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living costs continue to rise</a>, rent prices will likely follow in 2023.</p>
<p data-src="story/1789020">But surging living costs might not be the only factor to blame for rent rises. Another reason for increased rent prices might be access to data from across the country about rental prices. Even online searches about rental rates have increased between 2021 and 2022.</p>
<p data-src="story/1789020"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-30032 size-full" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Rent-Prices-Keyword.png" alt="Rent Prices Keyword" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Rent-Prices-Keyword.png 1080w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Rent-Prices-Keyword-300x300.png 300w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Rent-Prices-Keyword-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Rent-Prices-Keyword-150x150.png 150w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Rent-Prices-Keyword-768x768.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<p data-src="story/1789020">While these searches can be helpful for landlords and renters alike, access to information could increase rent prices or make a more competitive market.</p>
<p data-src="story/1789020">In fact, RealPage, a company that created <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/yieldstar-rent-increase-realpage-rent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an algorithm to help landlords</a> push rents to the limit for the type of property they have in their geographic location, was recently <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/realpage-accused-of-collusion-in-new-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued for collusion</a>. As a result, it is unclear how many of the rent price increases from large rental property owners were legitimately due to demand in that area.</p>
<h2 data-src="story/1789020">Trend #2: Co-living Emerges as a Popular Living Model</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-driven-record-rents-mean-more-people-are-piling-in-with-roommates-11666671826?mod=hp_lead_pos6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Journal reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that more Americans choose to live with another person. Apartment demand during 2022 fell to its lowest level in 13 years. Of those surveyed in September 2022, approximately 18% of adults reported </span><a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/lease-agreement/roommate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">living rent-free with a friend or relative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, about 11% at the same time last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, NyAi noticed that a growing number of users turn to co-living, potentially as </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/02/business/coliving-housing-dorms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a solution to cut living costs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to 2021, more landlords ask whether the applicant has experience living with others in their rental applications. Moreover, NyAi&#8217; total users for the templates&#8217; </span><a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/lease-agreement/room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">room rental agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/lease-agreement/roommate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">roommate agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increased by <strong>8.3% </strong>and a remarkable <strong>23.8%, </strong>respectively. Of all roommate agreement users, <strong>almost 30% co-live with two or more roommates</strong>. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-36769 aligncenter" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/co-living-trends-1024x1024.png" alt="co-living trends" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/co-living-trends-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/co-living-trends-300x300.png 300w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/co-living-trends-150x150.png 150w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/co-living-trends-768x768.png 768w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/co-living-trends.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renting rooms separately in cities with high demand also has its perks: landlords can charge up to 50% more on rent in a </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/02/business/coliving-housing-dorms.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-living </span>arrangement</a> than<span style="font-weight: 400;"> in apartments with a typical layout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no denying that many potential issues could arise while sharing living spaces; however, co-living may be the only option left for </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/08/realestate/nyc-rent-cost.html?smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renters who strive to stay in big cities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As rent prices are unlikely to fall in 2023, the co-living trend is expected to continue.</span></p>
<h2>Trend #3: Failure to Pay Rent Has Become the #1 Reason for Tenant Eviction</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, <strong>45 states</strong> in the US saw an increase in general evictions. That increase comes from many tenants having rental protections in 2020 and 2021 because of the </span><a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/rent-protections-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CARES Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and similar state restrictions on evictions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While eviction notices may be issued for many reasons, including lease violation and holdover, there has been an increase in tenants evicted for failing to pay rent in many states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some significant increases include Georgia&#8217;s roughly <strong>14% jump from 2021 (65.3%) to 2022 (79.2%)</strong>. Georgia also sees 3.4 more general </span><a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/eviction-notice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eviction notices created</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on NyAi per day. The state with the highest rate of renter-occupied housing units, <strong>New York</strong>, also saw a <strong>9% increase in evictions</strong> due to failure to pay rent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <aside class="tip style-highlight size-small align-none"> <div> <p> &#8220;Stricter late payment rules and the rise in evictions are a result of the rent moratorium during COVID.&#8221; </p> </div> </aside> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commented Tomas Satas, Founder and CEO at </span><a href="https://www.windycityhomebuyer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Windy City HomeBuyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;The evictions were held up for two years, and all hit this year.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But regarding the average total rent owed by an evicted tenant, <strong>California</strong> tops the state list with an astonishing <strong>$11,102.83</strong> in 2021 and <strong>$10,358.94</strong> in 2022. This and the growing number of daily evictions illustrate how tenants struggle to keep up with the rising rents and how landlords are more cautious about money matters than ever.</span></p>
<h2>Trend #4: Landlords Are Stricter with Tenant Obligations</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the economy remained stagnant, landlords became more protective of their rights. The average late fee for rent has increased from 2021 ($52.59) to 2022 (<strong>$58.18</strong>), and the average security deposit saw a rise of nearly $200 from $954.56 in 2021 to <strong>$1138.20 in 2022</strong>.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-30031 size-full" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Late-Fee-Increase.png" alt="Late Fee Increase" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Late-Fee-Increase.png 1080w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Late-Fee-Increase-300x300.png 300w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Late-Fee-Increase-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Late-Fee-Increase-150x150.png 150w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Late-Fee-Increase-768x768.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increase in late fees and security deposits may result from general increases in rent prices, but it also implies that landlords are struggling just as much as tenants. The New York Times reported that </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/27/business/economy/landlords-rent-inflation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">many midsize landlords and real estate management companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have experienced financial losses in 2022 due to skyrocketing costs, including taxes, insurance, and maintenance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some small landlords gave tenants a rent break during the pandemic and never received what was owed. Understandably, these unpleasant experiences have provoked landlords to become more cautious than ever.</span></p>
<h2>Trend #5: More Landlords Are Managing Out-of-State Properties</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overall number of landlords <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy7eaw/robot-landlords-are-buying-up-houses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managing properties out of state</a> <strong>has increased by 1.2%</strong> between 2021 (22.1%) and 2022 (23.3%). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some may attribute this increase to the </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/people-left-california-share-housing-renting-upgrades-pros-cons-moving-2022-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rising living costs of many renter-packed states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such as California and New York; however, other experts like </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidmbitton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Bitton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Co-founder &amp; CMO of </span><a href="https://www.doorloop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DoorLoop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, accredit this trend to the growth of the property management software market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <aside class="tip style-highlight size-small align-none"> <div> <p> &#8220;The pandemic has taught us that we can do many things entirely online, including property management. Real estate investing may be out of the question for someone who lives in a city such as NYC, where home prices are sky-high. Meanwhile, those living where home prices depreciate also consider investing in real estate elsewhere. In both cases, interested investors look at locales with sound demand but lower property costs. With property management software, these investors can become &#8216;laptop landlords&#8217; and enjoy the benefits of automation at a fraction of the cost.&#8221; </p> </div> </aside> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top states that have out-of-state landlords include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vermont: 31.72%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">District of Columbia(DC): 24.90%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delaware: 16.31%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Hampshire: 13.82%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho: 13.75%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kansas: 13.09%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada: 13.04%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nebraska: 12.77%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wyoming: 12.52%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon: 12.46%</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our findings echoed David&#8217;s comment. From 2021 to 2022, the number of NyAi&#8217; users opting for </span><a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/property-management-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">property management agreements</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>rose by about 30.1%</strong>. That might mean more landlords rely on property management companies and software to help maintain their out-of-state properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <aside class="tip style-tip size-small align-none"> <div> <header> <svg class="icon icon-lightbulb-on" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img"> <use xlink:href="#icon-lightbulb-on"></use> </svg> <h4>What is a property management software?</h4> </header> <p>Property management software, including </span><a href="https://butterflymx.com/blog/ai-property-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI property management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is an option many landlords use to manage their properties. They help property owners cut down on many mundane tasks of property ownership, such as lease administration, maintenance requests, and updating renter contact information.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of its convenience and accessibility, the global market for property management software has grown significantly over the past decade to </span><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/property-management-software-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3.04 billion worth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the next eight years, the market is expected to grow by almost 50%.</p> </div> </aside> </span></p>
<h2>Trend #6: Electronic Payment Options Are on the Rise</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might be surprised to learn that today, roughly </span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/397718/americans-using-cash-less-often-foresee-cashless-society.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60% of U.S.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> adults make “only a few” or no purchases using cash. Paper checks only account for about </span><a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/banking/consumer-payments/research-data-reports/2020/02/13/us-consumers-use-of-personal-checks-evidence-from-a-diary-survey/rdr2001.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7% of all consumer transactions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that account, landlords who accept <strong>electronic payments</strong> as a payment method for rent increased from 37.4% in 2021 to <strong>40.6% in 2022</strong>. Electronic payments can be directly withdrawn from a bank account but can also include sources like Venmo, PayPal, and Zelle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, while many landlords demand that owed rent be paid in person with cash from evicted tenants, more are also starting to accept electronic payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, in California, the </span><a href="https://data.census.gov/table?q=Owner/Renter+(Householder)+Characteristics&amp;g=0100000US$0400000&amp;y=2021&amp;tid=ACSST1Y2021.S2502" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state with the most renter-occupied housing units</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one in four landlords allows their evicted tenants to pay owed rent electronically. New York saw a 10% increase in landlords accepting electronic payments for owed rent.</span></p>

<h2>Trend #7: Remote Work Impacts Rental Demand</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote working boomed in 2020 because of shutdowns related to COVID-19. According to a </span><a href="https://owllabs.com/state-of-remote-work/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey from Owl Labs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> employees who choose to work remotely have increased by 24% since 2021. Interest in in-office work, nevertheless, fell by 24%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growing popularity of remote work nationwide has affected the rental market in many ways. Some renters </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/10/realestate/remote-work-housing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">turn to more affordable housing options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> away from expensive cities as they no longer need to commute; some renters look for amenities necessary to work from home. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattwardnashville/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Ward</a>, Realtor and Team Lead from the <a href="https://www.mattwardhomes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Ward Group</a>, commented on how this has impacted the housing market.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <aside class="tip style-highlight size-small align-none"> <div> <p></span>&#8220;In the second quarter of 2022, single-family and multifamily housing development dropped compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 in major cities and inner suburbs. Residential outmigration (buying properties in low-density regions and moving elsewhere) has reduced commutes into many metropolitan towns with the adaptation of working from home.&#8221;</p> </div> </aside> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And landlords are taking note. For instance, the number of landlords that include the cost of internet access in their rent rose from 31.1% in 2021 to <strong>33.8% in 2022</strong>. This number is expected to increase for the foreseeable future.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-30028 size-full" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Landlords-Provide-Wi-Fi.png" alt="Landlords Provide Wi-Fi" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Landlords-Provide-Wi-Fi.png 1080w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Landlords-Provide-Wi-Fi-300x300.png 300w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Landlords-Provide-Wi-Fi-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Landlords-Provide-Wi-Fi-150x150.png 150w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Landlords-Provide-Wi-Fi-768x768.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, many landlords are also making their properties smoke-free for a more comfortable working environment: The total number of leased properties that prohibit smoking increased by almost 2% from 2021 (79.3%) to 2022 (81.2%).</span></p>
<h2>Trend#8: Pet Owners Tend to Stay at Rental Properties Longer</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://www.iii.org/table-archive/22305" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Pet Owners Survey 2019-2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, roughly 136.4 million households had pets. As the pandemic hit and restrained many Americans from social activities in mid-2020, owning a pet became </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/22/us/dog-adoptions-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a solution for stress, boredom, and loneliness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Consequently, the number of households with pets has <strong>increased by about 20 million</strong> in the 2021-2022 Survey. The number of dogs solely accounted for almost one-third of the total increase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the remarkable growth in the number of pets across the nation during the pandemic, current data indicates a slight decrease in the number of properties that allow pets through a </span><a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/lease-agreement/pet-addendum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pet addendum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 2021 (64.9%) to 2022 (64.5%). Even the average amount of pet deposits remained roughly the same in both years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it&#8217;s interesting to note that allowing pets will likely lead to a longer rental period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NyAi found that tenants who stay in properties that allow pets are more stable. Specifically, in 2022, the average lease length at a property that allows pets was <strong>551 days</strong>. By contrast, the average stay at a location that did not allow pets was 464 days—that is almost a <strong>three-month difference</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it isn’t hard to understand why. Pets like dogs need </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/16/realestate/top-cities-dog-owners.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fenced yards and large indoor spaces</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; parks nearby are also a plus. 43% of US households agreed </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/realestate/pets-real-estate-sales-cats-dogs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they would move to accommodate their pets’ needs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Considering the limited number of pet-friendly properties and the increasing demand for them in the market, pet owners are certainly more motivated to sign a longer lease when they find the perfect place to accommodate their furry (or furless) friends.</span></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As 2023 is upon us, renters and landlords can start planning now for upcoming rental trends—from mobile payment methods to a potential decrease in demand. While rental rates might be high, renter demands may match those higher prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one can know what the real estate market will look like in 2023, but landlords and tenants need all the support they can get to navigate the upcoming changes. NyAi helps them simplify the legal work by enabling</span><a href="https://legaltemplates.net/real-estate/#tenants" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">tenants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://legaltemplates.net/real-estate/#landlords" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">landlords</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create the forms they need in the rental process.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, the business world is more competitive than ever before, and you need to ensure that you maximize the value of the resources at your disposal. That is where performance appraisals can be helpful. This is a periodic assessment that you can use to let an employee know how he or she is doing. Providing your employees with feedback puts them in the best position possible to be productive for your company.</p>
<p>At the same time, you must understand how to deliver a performance appraisal effectively. There are different types of performance appraisal below, so figure out which works best for your company. Whatever method you choose, it can be beneficial to use an <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/employee-evaluation/">employee evaluation form</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-29778 size-full" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Two-employees-signing-documents-706-471.jpg" alt="Two employees signing documents" width="706" height="471" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Two-employees-signing-documents-706-471.jpg 706w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Two-employees-signing-documents-706-471-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px" /></p>
<h2>What Is Performance Appraisal?</h2>
<p>A performance appraisal allows you to let an employee know how he or she is doing. Your employee is probably eager for feedback on his or her performance, and you want to maximize the value of each employee for your business.</p>
<p>You can use a performance appraisal to justify (or deny) bonuses or raises. You can also create a track record of performance appraisals if you need to terminate an <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/employment-contract/">employment contract</a>. Even though you can provide a performance appraisal at just about any time, most companies provide regular employee performance appraisals according to a set schedule. You might give employees performance appraisals quarterly, semi-annually, or yearly.</p>
<h2>Importance of Employee Performance Appraisal</h2>
<p>There are several reasons why you need to conduct employee performance appraisals. Some of the most important reasons include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reward employees</strong>: You need to reward employees who are doing well. If you give your employees incentives and bonuses to work hard, they will be more productive for the company.</li>
<li><strong>Create a culture of transparency</strong>: You can also use performance appraisals to create a culture of transparency. Your employees need to know how they are being judged and evaluated. With regular performance appraisals, you provide them with that information.</li>
<li><strong>Foster employee growth and development</strong>: If you want employees to be as productive as possible, you need to provide them with educational and development opportunities. For example, you can use performance appraisal to provide employees with goals for the next evaluation, which can foster their development.</li>
<li><strong>Identify employees with potential</strong>: Nobody will stay with your company forever. When people in leadership positions decide to depart, you need other employees to replace them. With periodic performance evaluations, you can identify employees who might be right for those positions.</li>
<li><strong>Collect feedback</strong>: Feedback goes both ways. Just as you will use a performance appraisal to provide employees with information on what they can do to improve, it also allows employees to provide you with feedback. That way, you can implement changes that can improve your work environment.</li>
<li><strong>Improve retention</strong>: To reduce turnover rates, you need to conduct regular performance appraisals. If your employees feel like they have a say in their work environments, they will be more likely to stick around, increasing your retention rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the biggest reasons you must regularly conduct performance appraisals. There are different ways to conduct an employee appraisal, and you need to figure out which one works best for your company.</p>
<h2>8 Modern Methods of Performance Appraisal</h2>
<p>There are a lot of methods for appraising performance. You must evaluate each option&#8217;s benefits and drawbacks before deciding which is right for your company. Eight performance appraisal methods you may want to consider include:</p>
<h3>1. Management by Objectives (MBO)</h3>
<p>One of the first performance appraisal methods you might want to use is called management by objectives. Usually shortened to MBO, this is where employees and managers will work together to identify objectives during a specific period.</p>
<p>Then, after those objectives have been set, you will meet with the employee from time to time to decide whether the employee is meeting those objectives. This is a strong performance appraisal method because it allows the employer to have a say in how he or she will be judged. When you set goals with your employee, you need to focus on setting objective goals that are easy to measure. That way, it will be easy to evaluate that employee&#8217;s performance down the road.</p>
<h3>2. Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS) Method</h3>
<p>Some employee performance appraisals are supposed to be quantitative as well as qualitative. One way to hit both areas is to develop a behaviorally anchored rating scale, or BARS.</p>
<p>This feedback method aims to compare each employee&#8217;s performance to specific behavioral examples located on the scale. The scale will provide a yardstick with which you can measure each employee&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p>You can use this feedback method to provide clear standards and correct employee behaviors while avoiding personal criticism. This is also a scale that allows you to remove bias and ensure the appraisal process is fair.</p>
<h3>3. 360-Degree Feedback Method</h3>
<p>Another popular performance appraisal method is called the 360-degree feedback method. In this method, you will collect feedback on an employee from everyone the employee comes into contact with. This includes customers, colleagues, superiors, and subordinates.</p>
<p>The goal of this feedback method is to eliminate bias during the performance appraisal and have a clear understanding of how the employee is performing. The biggest advantage of this feedback method is that it identifies opportunities for coaching, mentoring, and career development while increasing employee self-awareness. Remember that feedback from some areas will be more valuable than others, so you don&#8217;t necessarily want to weigh every review equally.</p>
<h3>4. Assessment Center Method</h3>
<p>Using the assessment center method, you will provide employees with a picture of how others observe them. Before the assessment, you will outline the objectives of the review process, design simulation exercises, and choose the debt rating method.</p>
<p>As the assessment unfolds, explain the purpose of the evaluation, conduct exercises with the employee, and identify strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Once the assessment is done, you will collect feedback from all reviewers, decide whether the results are valid, and share feedback with the employee. One of the biggest advantages of this feedback method is that you can enhance the employee’s knowledge and customize the feedback method to fit different areas of your business. This could be a strong feedback method for service-based companies, manufacturing organizations, and educational institutions.</p>
<h3>5. Human Resource Accounting Method</h3>
<p>The human resource accounting method can be beneficial if you want to place a monetary value on each employee. Essentially, you will compare the cost of retaining that employee (his or her salary and benefits) against the revenue that that employee generates for the company.</p>
<p>This is a great option for startup companies, where one employee can make or break the entire business&#8217;s success. On the other hand, this performance appraisal method will overlook intangible benefits that the employee brings, such as interpersonal relationships.</p>
<h3>6. Critical Incident Method</h3>
<p>In the critical incident method, you will identify specific examples of behaviors that have occurred during the evaluation period. Then, the review will focus on actions and behaviors that took place during the incident that either led to success or failure. To get the most out of this appraisal method, there must be clear documentation of what happened during the incidents in question. Then, the manager can provide the employee with feedback on what was done well, what was done poorly, and what can ensure success in the future.</p>
<h3>7. Psychological Appraisals</h3>
<p>If you want to identify the hidden potential in employees, you may want to use a psychological appraisal. This method aims to identify which employees will perform well in the future instead of focusing on their prior work.</p>
<p>This appraisal is going to focus on the cognitive abilities, interpersonal skills, leadership abilities, intellectual traits, emotional awareness, and personality traits of each employee.</p>
<p>Psychologists can use a variety of tests to provide companies with a variety of information, but this is a slow and arduous process. This can also be a great way to offer introverted employees a chance to stand out.</p>
<h3>8. Negotiated Appraisal</h3>
<p>Finally, you might also be interested in a negotiated appraisal. During this evaluation process, a mediator will participate in the employee evaluation. The reviewer will share what the employee is doing well before proceeding to areas of constructive criticism. Then, the employee will also provide his or her perspective on issues.</p>
<p>The mediator is responsible for making sure everyone is heard and that there are no areas of confusion.</p>
<p>This might be the preferred performance appraisal method if there are concerns about tension or disagreement between the evaluator and the employee.</p>
<h2>Best Performance Appraisal Method</h2>
<p>Because there are so many types of performance appraisal methods, you might be wondering about the most effective performance appraisal methods for your company. Remember that the right performance appraisal method for one company might not necessarily be the right method for yours. Furthermore, you may want to choose certain performance appraisal methods for certain employees. Either way, it can be advantageous to use an <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/employee-evaluation/#employee-evaluation-form-sample">employment evaluation template</a>.</p>
<p>You need to consider the size of your company, the information you want to deliver, and how the employee will be most receptive to what you have to say. If you select the best performance appraisal method for your company, you can put yourself and your company in the best position possible to maximize the value of each employee.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-29626 size-full" src="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Home-Office-with-calendar-706-471.jpg" alt="Home office with calendar" width="706" height="471" srcset="https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Home-Office-with-calendar-706-471.jpg 706w, https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/Home-Office-with-calendar-706-471-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px" /></p>
<h2>What Is a Leave of Absence?</h2>
<p><strong>A leave of absence is an option for employees who need to take time off work</strong> because they are experiencing circumstances that are out of the ordinary. Specifically, a leave of absence is <strong>different from paid time off (PTO), vacation time, and regular sick leave</strong>. Vacation time and sick leave are generally short-term absences, while a leave of absence is usually a long, possibly indefinite, absence.</p>
<p>For example, there are some employees who may take an extended leave because they have recently had a baby or they might have to take care of a family member who is seriously ill. Do not forget that if you are interested in taking a leave of absence from work, you may want to use a <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/employee/leave-of-absence-letter/#sample-leave-of-absence-letter">leave of absence letter template</a> to help you explain your situation. Your employer may also use a <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/employee/leave-of-absence-agreement/">leave of absence agreement</a>.</p>
<h2>Types of Leave of Absence</h2>
<p>There are <strong>different reasons why someone might need to take a leave of absence from work</strong>. Generally, the reasons for a leave of absence from work can be divided into mandatory and voluntary reasons.</p>
<h3>Mandatory Leave of Absence</h3>
<p>A leave of absence that is <strong>governed by federal law is considered mandatory</strong>. Generally, mandatory leaves of absence are governed by the Family Medical Leave Act (<a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>FMLA</u></a>) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (<a href="https://www.ada.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>ADA</u></a>).</p>
<p>Under FMLA, employees may be eligible for up to 12 weeks off without pay. Then, when that employee returns to work, they are generally restored to their former position or transitioned to an equivalent role. In some situations, employees might be entitled to extended leaves as collectively bargained by union representation.</p>
<h4>Mandatory leave of absence reasons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Medical leaves of absence governed by FMLA and ADA</li>
<li>Jury duty</li>
<li>Leaves for military service</li>
<li>Caring for a spouse, child, or family member who is ill</li>
<li>Adoption of a new child or foster care child</li>
</ul>
<h3>Voluntary Leave of Absence</h3>
<p>An extended leave of absence that is voluntary is generally up to the discretion of the employer. The <strong>employer is under no obligation to demand a voluntary leave of absence</strong>, but it could be a perk of the job. Furthermore, this type of leave does not provide the same protection as leaves of absence covered by the ADA or FMLA. That means that employees may not be able to return to the same position when the leave of absence ends.</p>
<h4>Voluntary leave of absence reasons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some employees may want to take a sabbatical.</li>
<li>Employees might need time off because they are moving.</li>
<li>Employees might want to go back to school to finish a degree.</li>
<li>Employees may need to take some time off for their mental health.</li>
<li>There might be a serious death in the family.</li>
<li>Employees might be going through a divorce.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)?</h2>
<p>The Family and Medical Leave Act, usually shortened to FMLA, is a labor law passed in 1993. Employers who have a certain number of employees are required to provide those employees with unpaid time off for serious family issues.</p>
<p>This act also provides employees access to continuing insurance coverage even if they do not continue to draw a salary while away from the company. The entire purpose of this act is to provide families with time to deal with emergencies without worrying about whether their job will be there when they come back.</p>
<p>This program is governed by the US Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division (DOL-WHD). Under this act, the workplace demands are balanced with the needs of families, promoting an environment of economic security and stability. Employers may have a legitimate interest in filling an open position while an employee is away, but the employee also deserves to be protected while dealing with a legitimate family concern.</p>
<h3>FMLA Requirements</h3>
<p>Under this law, employees can take up to 12 weeks off for various reasons. After 12 weeks, the employee can return to the company, but if their former position is no longer available, they are required to be offered an equivalent position with the company. This includes a job with equal pay and status.</p>
<p><strong>What conditions qualify for FMLA?</strong></p>
<p>To qualify for FMLA leave, the employee has to work for a company that has at least 50 employees that work within a 75-mile radius of the work site. Furthermore, the employee must have worked at least 1,250 hours for the company during the past 12 months.</p>
<h4>Eligible reasons to take FMLA include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>A qualifying military emergency</li>
<li>The birth of a new child</li>
<li>Bringing in a new child who has been adopted</li>
<li>Welcoming a new foster child into the home</li>
<li>Providing care for an immediate family member who has gotten sick</li>
<li>An employee who has developed a serious health condition</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Should You Ask for a Leave of Absence From Work?</h2>
<p>If you’re interested in asking for a leave of absence from work, there are several steps to follow.</p>
<h3>1. Always Check Your Company Policies First</h3>
<p>Review the protections given for a mandatory leave of absence. Then, look at the types of voluntary leave that are granted, whether leaves are paid or unpaid, and how long you are allowed to be away from work. Your <a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/employment-contract/">employment contract</a> could also contain details you need to be aware of.</p>
<h3>2. If You Have a Supervisor, You Should Speak to Your Boss</h3>
<p>Make sure your boss is aware of your situation ahead of time. You might need your supervisor to back up your reasoning when you approach the company to ask for leave. Try to get everything in writing.</p>
<h3>3. Submit a Formal Request in Writing</h3>
<p>Use a<a href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/employee/leave-of-absence-letter/"> leave of absence letter</a> to specify the type of leave you need, how much time off you will need, and indicate a specific date for your return. Always ask the company if you need to take any further steps before submitting your request.</p>
<h3>4. Try to Give as Much Notice as Possible</h3>
<p>Even though emergencies may come up from time to time, giving your company more notice can increase the chances of you getting your request approved.</p>

<h2>Tips for Asking for a Leave of Absence From Work</h2>
<p>A few tips to follow when asking for a leave of absence include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always ask if there is anything to do to help make the transition easier for the person picking up your duties while you are away.</li>
<li>Give concrete start and end dates for your leave of absence.</li>
<li>Think about whether you can continue to work at home even if you cannot come into the office.</li>
<li>In addition to informing your boss and supervisor, always inform your colleagues if you are taking a leave of absence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make the process as easy as possible for the company if you take a leave of absence.</p>
<h2>Reasons To Take Leave of Absence From Work</h2>
<p>There are several reasons someone might need to take a leave of absence from work.</p>
<h3>Good Reasons to Take Leave of Absence From Work</h3>
<p>There are several good reasons to take a leave of absence from work. Some of the most common examples include the birth of a new trial, adopting a new child, providing care for a family member who is seriously ill, or taking a leave of absence to serve in the military.</p>
<p>If you have developed a serious health condition yourself, you can also take a leave of absence from work that is protected by FMLA. If you want to take a leave of absence that is protected by FMLA, you may need to have documentation from a healthcare provider or other regulatory authority, such as your military commander (if you are taking a leave for military reasons).</p>
<h3>Bad Reasons to Take Leave of Absence From Work</h3>
<p>On the other hand, there are some bad reasons to take a leave of absence from work. For example, if you simply want extra vacation time and to travel the world, that is not a good reason to request a voluntary leave of absence.</p>
<p>Or, if you try to tell your employer that you can&#8217;t come to work for a long time because your car is going to take several weeks to get fixed, that is not a good reason for a leave of absence. You should try to find an alternative mode of transportation.</p>
<p>In general, if you are requesting a leave of absence because of a bad situation you created, your employer will probably be hesitant to give you a voluntary leave.</p>
